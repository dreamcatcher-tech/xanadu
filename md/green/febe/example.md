**FeBe
Example **

---

This
chapter is
presented in the spirit of the "hello world" example
from the
Kernighan and Ritchie "C" book [K&R
78].
It is being presented early, before the background necessary to
properly
understand it, so that those who prefer some concreteness upon
which to
hang abstract concepts can feel oriented. Those who prefer to
first read
about concepts and definitions should skip this chapter now and
return to
it later. This chapter refers to many later chapters; the reader
should
not expect to understand these until the [Technical
Overview](overview.html) has been read.

Fixed pitch font in this
chapter was
generated by capturing the messages exchanged between a frontend
and a backend
in an actual Udanax Green session. Each message from the frontend
is preceded
by a comment line beginning with "**fe:**", and each
response
from the backend by a line beginning with
"**be:**".

The session consisted of:

* bringing up the frontend and backend in the single
user configuration
on the standard example data structure file. (See the [man-pages](man-pages.html)
"backend(L)" and "intf(L)" in Appendix
C.)

* the frontend starting, displaying a particular start
document
(referred to as Document A in the rest of this
chapter),

* the user following a link from Document A to the
document at the
other end of that link (Document B), and

* the user quitting.



The first thing the frontend and backend did was check whether
they spoke
the same protocol:

**fe:** Do you speak the prototype protocol?

P0~

**be: **Yes I speak the prototype protocol

P0~

Note that the lines right below "**fe:**" and
"**be:**"
were new-line characters (denoted by the symbol `')_
_that were sent in the messages.

Because the frontend wished to speak the prototype protocol, it
indicated
this by sending some new-lines (at least one), followed by `P0~'.
The prototype backend ignored all input until it got a new-line,
and consumed
as many new-lines as were there. Since it then found `P0~',
it responded with a new-line followed by a `P0~'.
If the prototype backend received anything other than `P0~'
from the frontend, it would have returned new-line `P?~'
and considered the session terminated. (If a future backend does
not speak
the prototype protocol, it will return something else and consider
the session
terminated. There is no reason to expect that any future frontend
or backend
will support the prototype protocol, but future products
*will* support
the above protocol for negotiating about what protocol they are
speaking.)
(See the section about metaprotocol in the man-pages
"backend(L)"
and "daemon(L)" in [Appendix
C](man-pages.html).)



Having agreed that they were both speaking the prototype protocol,
the frontend
proceeded to open Document A:

**fe:** Can I have read-access to *doc-A* or a copy?

35~0.1.1.0.1.0.1~1~2~

**be:** You now have read-access to *doc-A* itself

35~0.1.1.0.1.0.1~

In the FeBe Protocol, tilde (~)
and new-line () are terminators, and
are used
to terminate each of the input and output arguments. (See the
section
"Lexical Definitions" in Appendix A.) Requests from
the frontend
always begin with a request number, followed by the arguments
for that
request. If the backend successfully responds (as above), the
response
consists of that same request number followed by result
arguments.

Translated into the terminology of the syntax definition
chapters (see
the chapter "[FeBe
Protocol](protocol.html)" and
[Appendix A](syntax.html): "FeBe Protocol
Syntax"),
the frontend said:

![](../images/request-anatomy.gif)

The backend responded with:

![](../images/request-part.gif)

Note that we used the brackets () when speaking in the
metasyntax as
defined in Appendix A: "FeBe Protocol Syntax".

The frontend requested that the document with address 1.1.0.1.0.1 (Document
A) be opened for reading. Addresses in Udanax Green consist of multi-part
numbers which we call "tumblers". (See "[Addressing](addressing.html)" and "[Tumbler
Arithmetic](tumblers.html)".) Address 1.1.0.1.0.1 is a document *id* simply
known to this frontend as a good starting point (much as a home directory
under Unix). Because many tumblers sent in the protocol may have some
number of leading zeros, the protocol uses a compressed format in which
the first digit denotes the number of leading zeros to be appended to
the rest of the digits to form the actual tumbler. For example, a `3.4.5' in the protocol would represent tumbler 0.0.0.4.5
(see the section "Lexical Definitions" in [Appendix
A](syntax.html)).

The *copy-on-conflict* argument
indicated to
the backend that should it not be able to open Document A for
this frontend
(because, for example, someone else had it open for writing),
then the
backend should instead create a new version (a virtual copy),
and open
it. If the backend had made and opened a copy, it would have
returned
the *id* of the copy. Since, in the example, the backend
returned
the original *id*, the open succeeded on the requested
document.
(See the chapter "Versions".)



As seen below, the frontend next requested the first 1,500
characters
of this document. It did so with a request of the form:

![](../images/retrieve.gif)

where *vspan* represented the part of
the document
starting at 1.1 extending for 0.1500. This indicated the
interval from
1.1 inclusive to (1.1 + 0.1500) exclusive. As 1.1 + 0.1500 =
1.1501, the
interval included all characters from location 1.1 up to but not
including
1.1501, or, the first 1,500 characters in the document's data
space. (See
"[Tumbler Arithmetic](tumblers.html)".)

The backend responded with:

![](../images/retrieve-num.gif)

Since there were only 553 characters in the data space of the
document,
only these were returned.

Note that the text of Document A (which follows) is a description of the
Udanax Green Prototype Frontend commands. Also, the () immediately following `t553~' is in fact the first character of the retrieved
document.

**fe:** What's in *doc-A* starting at 1.1 for 0.1500?

5~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.1~1~0.1.1~1.1500~

**be:** The following 553 characters:

5~1~t553~

The frontend now had the full data space of Document A, but also
needed
the link connectivity information in order to properly display the
document.
The prototype frontend highlighted text to which links attached.
(See "fex(L)"
in Appendix C.) It requested this information by: where there was
one spec
in the spec-set; the spec's document *id* was 1.1.0.1.0.1;
the spec
contained one vspan; it started at 1.1 and extended for 1. Note
that 1.1
+ 1 = 2, and that therefore the interval indicated was from 1.1
inclusive
to 2 exclusive. (This shows how tumbler arithmetic can easily
specify infinite
intervals: the above interval denotes the entire data space of the
document
no matter how big it is.) (See the chapters "Addressing"
and "Tumbler
Arithmetic".)

**fe:** What are all the end-sets in the data space of
*doc-A*?

28~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.1~1~0.1.1~0.1~

** be:** One from-set in *doc-A* starting at
1.504 for
0.49, one to-set starting at 1.2 for 0.6, no three-set

28~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.1~1~0.1.504~1.49~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.1~1~0.1.2~1.6~0~<
/font>

This meant there was a link from characters
504 through 552 (inclusive); there was a link to characters 2 through 7
(inclusive); but there was no link whose three-set included any of the characters
in this document. Characters 504 through 552 were "Follow this link
to get to the index of documents" above, which the frontend therefore
highlighted in its display of the document.

To see if there was any more data in Document A to be retrieved,
the frontend
sent the request:

**fe:** How big are the spaces in *doc-A*?

1~0.1.1.0.1.0.1~

**be:** One space, starting at 1.1 for 0.553

1~1~0.1.1~1.553~

Essentially, the backend said that Document A contained 553
characters and
no links. If the document had contained any links, then the
response would
have been of the form: where one of the *vspans* would have
indicated
the span starting at 2.1 for 0.*number-of-links*.

Back to our example: the user of the frontend had just moved to
character
513 and hit the follow-link button. Character 513 was within the
from-set
of some link (as was known from the above *retrieve-endsets*
request).
The frontend needed to follow that link, so it had to determine
what link
or links contained that character as an end-set. It did this with
the request:
, where *spec-set**from
*was: , or, the single character at location 513 in the
document.
The other spec-sets were empty, which indicated no
match-restrictions there.

**fe:** What are all the links from position 513 of
*doc-A*

30~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.1~1~0.1.513~1.1~0~0~0~

**be:** Just one: link *id* 1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.22

30~1~0.1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.22~

The backend responded with: indicating that the links that matched
the above
query consisted solely of the link with *id*
1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.22. This
was the twenty-second link in the link-space of document
1.1.0.1.0.2 (see
the chapter "Addressing"). From now on, we will refer to
the document
at address 1.1.0.1.0.2 as Document B.

Since only one link was involved, the frontend decided to follow
that link.
The frontend first inquired about the three-set of the link by
sending:

**fe:** What is the three-end of the link attached to?

18~3~0.1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.22~

**be:** It is attached to the first link of *doc-B*

18~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~1~0.2.1~1.1~

The backend responded: , or, the first link in Document B. This
indicated
the link's type, which the frontend used to decide how to display
the action
of following the link. (See the chapter "Links and Link
Types".)

Then the frontend inquired about the to-end of the same link:

**fe:** What is the to-end of the link attached to?

18~2~0.1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.22~

**be:** To the first fifty-seven characters of *doc-B*

18~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~1~0.1.1~1.57~

The backend responded that the to-set of this link consisted of
the first
fifty-seven characters of Document B. As this was the document at
the other
end of the link we followed, we needed to display it. The sequence
of requests
to retrieve the contents and links of Document B followed the same
pattern
as for Document A.

First we opened it:

**fe:** Can I have read-access to *doc-B* or a copy?

35~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~1~2~

**be:** You now have read-access to *doc-B* itself

35~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~

Then we asked for the first 1500 characters. As before, this
document contained
less than 1500 characters - in this case, 875.

**fe:** What are in the first 1500 locations of *doc-B*?

5~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~1~0.1.1~1.1500~

**be:** The following 875 characters:

5~1~t875~To read the document, follow the link associated with it.

Then the frontend did a for the data space of the document:

**fe:** What are all the end-sets in the data space of
*doc-B*?

28~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~1~0.1.1~0.1~

**be:** Here they are:

28~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~31~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~ 1.1~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.75~1.9~0.1.102~1.35~0.1.143~1.11~0.1.232~
1.11~0.1.253~1.13~0.1.276~1.6~0.1.317~1.6~0.1.333~1.5~0.1.348~ 1.5~0.1.363~1.5~0.1.447~1.4~0.1.492~1.6~0.1.542~1.9~0.1.569~
1.11~0.1.682~1.8~0.1.694~1.12~0.1.707~1.14~0.1.748~1.8~0.1.765~ 1.8~0.1.782~1.8~0.1.799~1.8~0.1.799~1.8~0.1.816~1.8~0.1.833~
1.8~0.1.850~1.8~0.1.867~1.8~1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~6~0.1.1~1.57~ 0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~1.1~1~v~
0.1.1.0.1.0.2~5~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~1.1~0.1.1~1.1~<
/font>

The backend responded with: where:

*spec-set**from* is:*
*`1~' * [`v~'* iddoc-B *`31~'* [*vspan*]]

*spec-setto* is:* *`1~' * [`v~'* iddoc-B *`6~'* [*vspan*]]

*spec-setthree* is:* *`1~' * [`v~'* iddoc-B *`5~'* [*vspan*]]

This response informed the frontend of the thirty-one spans in Document
B which were in the from-space of some link, the six spans which were in
the to-space of some link, and the five spans which were in the three-space
of some link. For example, the from-span starting at 1.75 for 0.9 denoted
that the text `the intro' was in the from-space of (at
least) one link, and therefore that the user could follow it to more material.

Finally, the user told the frontend to quit; the frontend in turn asked
the backend to quit; the backend informed the frontend that it had quit;
and the session was terminated.

**fe:** I'm ready to quit, how about you?

16~

**be:** Sure, goodbye.
