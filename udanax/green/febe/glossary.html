                    <dir> <b> account</b> An account is the system's representation 
                      of a user. The account includes that users' documents. Users 
                      can have multiple accounts.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> Be</b> Short for backend.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> backend</b> One of two high-level modules required for 
                      a Udanax Green hypertext system. The backend is responsible 
                      for document and version storage, link management and editing. 
                      In many installations it will run on a more powerful computer 
                      networked to the individual workstation where users work. 
                      (See &quot;frontend&quot;.)<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> data-byte</b> The smallest addressable unit of storage 
                      in the Udanax Green FeBe Protocol. A data-byte is an eight 
                      bit unsigned binary number.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> data</b> <b>space</b> The part of a document that contains 
                      arbitrary data, supplied by the user or front-ends. The 
                      other space in documents is the link space.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> document</b> A block of information in a hypermedia 
                      information pool that is thematically unified. Such documents 
                      resemble contemporary paper documents except that clips 
                      of animation, pictures, and sound tracks may also be documents. 
                      Also, in fully integrated hypermedia systems, the typical 
                      document will likely be smaller in size - closer to the 
                      length of an article in a newspaper than to the length of 
                      a book.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> docuverse</b> The abstract address space that contains 
                      all Udanax Green objects.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> end-set</b> The sets that describe links. Each link 
                      has three end-sets: a from-set, a to-set, and a three-set. 
                      The three end-sets are operationally the same, but by convention, 
                      links start at the from-set and end at the to-set, and have 
                      a type as defined by their three-set. Each link also has 
                      a home-set.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> Fe</b> Short for frontend.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> FeBe Protocol</b> Frontends communicate with the backend 
                      using a standard, public protocol called FeBe (stands for 
                      &quot;<b>F</b>ront<b>e</b>nd <b>B</b>ack<b>e</b>nd&quot;). 
                      Other sections of this package describe the preliminary 
                      protocol used by the current system.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> from-set</b> The set of elements from which a link `starts'. 
                      (See &quot;end-set&quot;.)<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> frontend</b> One of the two high-level modules required 
                      for a multi-user Udanax Green hypertext system. The frontend 
                      is responsible for presenting the information from the backend 
                      to the user on his or hers workstation. (See &quot;backend&quot;.) 
                      It supports users in reading, creating, and editing information.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> home-set</b> The set of documents that actually contain 
                      a given link in their contents. Note that the home of a 
                      document is independent from any of its end-sets.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> hypertext</b> Any form of non-linear writing. This includes 
                      paper mechanisms such as table of contents and indexes. 
                      Computerized hypertext allows readers to navigate through 
                      large quantities of information.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> hypermedia</b> Everything that hypertext does, but NOW 
                      IMPROVED! NOW WITH PICTURES, ANIMATION, AND SOUND!<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> ID</b> A global tumbler address of a document, link, 
                      data-byte, etc. The ordering of the addresses groups related 
                      things. For example, the documents of a single user have 
                      contiguous addresses.<br>
                      <br>
                      The component of a hypertext document that describes and 
                      maintains interconnections between blocks of information. 
                      In Udanax Green a link has three parts. (For a complete 
                      explanation, please read the chapter &quot;Links and Link 
                      Types&quot;.) Frequently, however, the pieces have the following 
                      usage: the from-set describes the block of information from 
                      which the link originates, the to-set describes the block 
                      of text to which the origin is linked, and the three-set 
                      describes the link's type.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> links:link space</b> The part of a document in which 
                      links reside. The other space is the data space.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> node</b> A running Udanax Green backend, and all information 
                      it contains.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> span</b> An span specifies a range of tumblers with 
                      a starting tumbler and a tumbler width. The span includes 
                      all tumblers between the start inclusive and the start plus 
                      the width exclusive. (See the chapter &quot;Tumbler Arithmetic&quot;.) 
                      Because of the uniformity of addressing, spans can represent 
                      ranges of data-bytes, links, documents, and even users.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> spec</b> Many of the FeBe operations use a set of specs 
                      to specify a set of arbitrary Udanax Green objects. A spec 
                      is either a span of globally addressed elements like documents, 
                      or a document identifier and a set of vspans (document local 
                      spans).<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> three-set</b> The end-set which determines the type 
                      of a link, by convention.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> to-set</b> The end-set which a link points to, by convention.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> tumbler</b> Tumblers are multi-part ordinal numbers 
                      similar to the Dewey Decimal System. For example, 1.0.34.5 
                      and 123.56.87.1.1.3.4 are both tumblers. Since they can 
                      expand at any point, a numbering system based on them never 
                      runs out of precision. Udanax Green uses tumblers for all 
                      address to allow any number of nodes, users, documents, 
                      data-bytes, and links. (See the chapters &quot;Addressing&quot; 
                      and &quot;Tumbler Arithmetic&quot;.)<br>
                      <br>
                      A document initially created as a virtual copy of some other 
                      document.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> vspan</b> A vspan describes a range of the contents 
                      of a single document. Like a span, a vspan has a start and 
                      width tumblers. The tumblers are relative to the document, 
                      however. The vspan designates everything between the start 
                      tumbler inclusive and the start plus the width exclusive. 
                      The width can cross the boundaries of space within the document. 
                      (See the chapter &quot;Addressing&quot;.)<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> width</b> The size of a span; the sum of the origin 
                      tumbler and width tumbler is the first thing past the end 
                      of the span.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> Udanax Green</b> A hypertext backend designed to allow 
                      multiple concurrent users to have fast retrieval and update 
                      of hypertext information pools of unbounded size.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b> Udanax Green:Udanax Green objects</b> Nodes, accounts, 
                      documents, links, and data-bytes are all objects in the 
                      Udanax Green address space (also called &quot;the docuverse&quot;).<br>
