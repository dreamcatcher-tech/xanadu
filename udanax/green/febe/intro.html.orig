      <font size=4><b> Udanax.com<br>
      <br>
      </b></font><br>
      This overview brings you up to date on Udanax’s business situation as of 
      1988, plans for the software, release dates, and how frontend developers 
      fit into the picture.<br>
      <br>
      Since 1979 (till 1995) Udanax.com has been developing the software to implement 
      a full-featured hypertext system as originally envisioned by Ted Nelson 
      in 1960 and since expanded by the Udanax team. This software will provide 
      a powerful, unified system for storing, relating and managing any type of 
      information: text, graphics, multimedia, CAD/CAM drawings, music, numbers. 
      Today, the code already embodies all the basic capabilities necessary for 
      a full-featured hypertext system: links, versions, and support for cooperating 
      users.<br>
      <br>
      In April 1988, Autodesk, Inc. of Sausalito, California, best known for their 
      AutoCAD family of software, acquired a majority interest in Udanax.com and 
      is providing the funding and support needed to complete the first Udanax 
      hypertext product and bring it to market. We have announced late 1989 as 
      our goal for our first product release.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Product Development Plans<br>
      <br>
      </b></font> The capabilities that we plan to add continue the same themes. 
      A partial list of extensions includes: 
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <dir> 
            <dir> • more platforms on which Udanax Green runs<br>
              <br>
              • communicating backends sharing documents<br>
              <br>
              • addition of timestamps to better keep track of different versions<br>
              <br>
              • implementation of access control and permissions<br>
              <br>
              • addition of a historical trace which contains the edit history 
              and version history of documents. </dir>
          </dir>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <font size=4><b>Developers and Frontends<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>In the context of the Udanax Green system, the backend handles 
      storage, retrieval, versioning, linking and editing of data with no knowledge 
      about the nature of the data being handled. The backend never interacts 
      directly with the user; there is always a frontend handling the FeBe Protocol.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to the backend, frontends are advanced application packages 
      that: 
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <dir> 
            <dir> • interact with users<br>
              <br>
              • interface to input and output devices<br>
              <br>
              • interpret the stored data as text, pictures or music<br>
              <br>
              • format the data for display<br>
              <br>
              • incorporate numeric manipulations or other operations to be worked 
              on data<br>
              <br>
              • are specialized to serve particular market needs<br>
              <br>
              • create, implement and manage the metaphors for working in hypertext 
              and hypermedia environments. </dir>
          </dir>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      Frontends will be primarily produced by third party developers. Udanax.com 
      does plan to produce at least one general purpose frontend exemplar that 
      demonstrates wide usage of hypertext features, and explores some of the 
      new capabilities now possible. This frontend will serve as a guide for software 
      developers, and ensure that a piece of generalized hypertext software is 
      available for the first product release date. Udanax.com does <i>not</i> 
      intend to compete with third party developers. Udanax.com will cooperate 
      with and assist its third party frontend developers.<br>
      <br>
      With the backend’s universal ability to handle any type of input and any 
      size document network, Udanax Green can be fitted to a wide range of applications 
      in all market segments. In thinking about hypertext issues, we have identified 
      six areas which, because of their inherent information complexity and the 
      established presence of computer technology, are strong candidates for early 
      frontend applications: 
      <dir> 
        <dir> 1. CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) Software development 
          and maintenance<br>
          <br>
          A software development and maintenance product could use the Udanax 
          backend to handle documentation, and manage both source and object code, 
          while the frontend would offer local capabilities for compiling, executing 
          and debugging programs.<br>
          <br>
          2. CAD/CAM/CAE and Engineering Project Documentation Management<br>
          <br>
          The Udanax backend allows precise control over the growth of versions 
          and variations in documents and diagrams. Customized and up-to-the-minute 
          system descriptions can be developed more reliably, more quickly, and 
          less expensively.<br>
          <br>
          3. Document Library Storage and Retrieval (research groups, legal, etc.)<br>
          <br>
          Procedure manuals, policy manuals and catalogs can be annotated for 
          both public and private use. The rich interconnection of different sections 
          of documents allows the occasional user to swiftly find relevant items; 
          the annotations allow the refinement of understanding achieved with 
          experience to propagate throughout the organization at great speed. 
          The result is a swifter evolution of the organization’s policies and 
          procedures, and swifter adaptation to changing tools, capabilities, 
          and situations.<br>
          <br>
          4. Office Automation and Intra-Organizational Communications Systems<br>
          <br>
          Most people work in groups, and the projects they work on are increasingly 
          complex. Udanax hypertext makes possible group thinking, planning and 
          writing. In one example, multiple people commonly work on single documents 
          and wonder who made what change to the current draft. A single project 
          produces multiple documents, all of which must be kept consistent: specifications, 
          documentation, product announcement. The complexity cascades as the 
          change of a single number or word must be traced out into every other 
          document and corrected. Hypertext embodies the operations necessary 
          to trace sources, track versions, attribute revisions, and ensure consistency 
          during the process.<br>
          <br>
          5. Management of Data in Complex Formats (e.g., cartographic or geographic 
          data)<br>
          <br>
          Research institutes often have a variety of complex data, all in non-standard 
          formats. For a cartographic group this might include soil sample lab 
          tests, seismic charts, LANDSAT and SPOT photos, artists’ sketches, field 
          reports, historical records. Only hypertext can create a database for 
          the management of complex format data of this sort.<br>
          <br>
          6. Computer Aided Instruction<br>
          <br>
          The blending of multiple media – text, graphics, animation and video 
          – allows the construction of educational material that holds the reader’s 
          interest. The rich linking of training modules gives the reader the 
          ability to browse the material, focusing on those sections relevant 
          to his curiosity at any moment, giving him a level of control over the 
          order of presentation previously impossible. </dir>
      </dir>
      This may only scratch the surface of current market opportunities. We are 
      looking forward to being surprised and impressed by the variety, inventiveness 
      and elegance of applications created by frontend developers.<br>
      <br>
      We are interested in encouraging qualified software developers, and in exploring 
      a variety of possible relationships regarding both software development 
      and marketing.
