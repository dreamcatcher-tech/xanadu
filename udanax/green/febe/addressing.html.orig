      <div align="left"><font size=6> </font>Every object in the Xanadu backend 
        has a unique global address that functions as the object’s identifier. 
        This chapter identifies the objects that can be addressed in the backend, 
        and describes the generation of their addresses.<br>
        <br>
        <font size=4><b>Tumbler<br>
        <br>
        </b></font>All addresses in Xanadu are <i>tumblers</i>. Tumblers are multi-part 
        ordinal numbers similar to Dewey Decimal numbers. For example, 2.4.23 
        and 45.6.72 are both tumblers. Each period separated number is called 
        a tumbler digit. The digits of a tumbler (leftmost first) exactly describe 
        the path to a specific point in a tree. Xanadu address tumblers use the 
        zero tumbler digit only to separate concatenated fields within the tumbler. 
        This will be shown below. </div>

              <dir> 
                <dir> <font face="Zapf Dingbats" size=6> +</font> Tumblers are 
                  transmitted in a compressed format within the FeBe Protocol. 
                  Example tumblers in this chapter do <i>not</i> use that representation.

      <font size=4><b>Node<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Each running backend is called a node in anticipation of an interconnected 
      network of Xanadu backends. Each node has a unique tumbler that positions 
      it in an abstract global address space called the <i>docuverse</i>. Since 
      node addresses are tumblers, any node could give addresses to new nodes 
      by appending another tumbler digit to its own tumbler address. For example, 
      node 23.4 could create nodes 23.4.1, 23.4.2, 23.4.3, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Account<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Each node has account<i>s</i> for any number of users. Each account 
      on a single node is identified by a tumbler. Xanadu currently makes no use 
      of the potential hierarchy of accounts. The global address of an account 
      is the concatenation of the node’s address, the tumbler separator, and the 
      account’s tumbler. The separator allows any number of tumbler digits for 
      the node address.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Document<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Accounts contain any number of document<i>s</i>. New documents 
      are numbered sequentially for each account. Addresses for versions get allocated 
      like addresses for nodes: the first new version adds a tumbler digit. Each 
      successive version increments the last digit. Each of these new versions 
      can create versions of their own by adding more digits. The global address 
      of any document is created by concatenating the global address of the document’s 
      account, the zero tumbler, and the document’s address relative to its account.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Data-Bytes and Links<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The final level of addressing is for the contents of documents. Documents 
      have two spaces, the data space for storing raw data such as text and pictures, 
      and the link space for storing document interconnections. Characters and 
      links are addressed within a document by a two digit tumbler. The first 
      digit identifies the space (data=1, links=2); the second identifies the 
      position within that space. Thus, the thirty-ninth character has address 
      1.39 whereas the fourth link has the address 2.4. As above, global addresses 
      for characters and links are made by appending (with a separator) their 
      addresses to the global address of their home document – the document in 
      which they were created. The home document is unique, even though edit operations 
      and versioning can copy a link to many documents.<br>
      <br>
      All addresses used in the FeBe Protocol are global except addresses used 
      in some commands that stay within the bounds of a single document. These 
      addresses, called vaddresses, are relative to the document, and so have 
      only two digits. The containing document is supplied as a separate argument. 
      For historical reasons, document relative terms are annotated with 'v'.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Groups of Xanadu Objects<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Groups of Xanadu objects can be referred to with spans, vspans, 
      and spec-sets. A span represents a range of global tumbler addresses. A 
      vspan is a range of addresses relative to a single document. A spec-set 
      is a list of spans or vspans (with an associated document identifier). Spec-sets 
      allow specification of an arbitrarily complex set of Xanadu objects.<br>
      <br>
      Spans are represented with a start tumbler and a width tumbler. The start 
      tumbler is the address of the first thing in the span. The start tumbler 
      plus the width tumbler (see the chapter &quot;Tumbler Arithmetic&quot;) 
      is the address of the first thing <i>not</i> included in the span.<br>
      <br>
      Vspans are built from document relative tumblers (vaddresses). Thus, the 
      entire data space of a document is in the vspan with a start of 1.1 and 
      a width of 1 . This vspan covers from the first data-byte data up to but 
      not including the first link.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Tumbler Ordering<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Tumblers are ordered similar to real number fractions. For example, 
      4 &lt; 4.23 &lt; 4.23.7 &lt; 4.24 &lt; 5. Thus, a single span could cover 
      all the documents for a given account, all the accounts (and their documents) 
      for a given node, all the versions of a particular document, etc. Because 
      addresses at every level of the hierarchy are just tumblers, spans can cover 
      characters, links, documents, versions, or any other Xanadu entities, including 
      the entire docuverse.
