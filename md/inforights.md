Everyone is arguing about copyright and electronic publishing; few pay
attention either to the law or the great possibility.

By law, the publisher is the person or entity responsible for published
content. And "Electronic Publishing" cannot, must not mean only closed
objects that have to be used separately. The great possibility is a
world of combinable objects that may be linked by users: **OPEN
HYPERMEDIA PUBLISHING**.

We want an enchanted grove, a fair playing field, where all connections
and quotations are allowed and sorted out. Copyright law by itself
won't do it; and so we extend the law by a system of contracts. If this
is a world in which you would like to work and play, Welcome to Xanadu.
