      <!-- #BeginEditable "LongBody" --> <font size=6> </font>The connection that 
      a link represents is defined by spec-sets called end-sets. Each link has 
      three end-sets: a from-set, a to-set, and a three-set. These three end-sets 
      are operationally the same, but by convention, links start at the from-set 
      and end at the to-set, and have a type as defined by their three-set.<br>
      <br>
      Frontends create links by specifying the three end-sets and a document in 
      which to store the link. This document is the link’s home document. The 
      address of the link within its home document is the link’s global identifier. 
      Note that the home document and end-sets of a link are completely independent. 
      A link in a document could connect from the contents of another document 
      to the contents of still other documents.<br>
      <br>
      Each link has a final, virtual property called its home-set. It is the set 
      of all documents that store the link in their link space. This initially 
      contains just the home document of the link, but editing and version creation 
      operations can cause a link to exist in more than one document.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Link Types<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>The current, unimaginative scheme for link typing simply associates 
      each type with a tumbler address. The three-set for a quote link, for example, 
      just contains the tumbler address associated with type &quot;quote&quot;. 
      Below are listed the values used for the example Xanadu system:<br>
      <br>
      <font size=2>&nbsp; </font> 
      <dir> </dir>
              <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <dir> 
            <dir> <font size=2> jump 1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.1<br>
              <br>
              quote 1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.2<br>
              <br>
              footnote 1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.3<br>
              <br>
              marginal note 1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.4</font> </dir>
          </dir>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      Much more powerful conventions will completely replace this in the product 
      release.<br>
      <br>
      The end-set used to designate a link’s type is deliberately misnamed to 
      escape the assumption that a type is just a symbol. The simplest improvement 
      makes each type a document that stores a description of the uses and conventions 
      for the given type. In a more interesting example, type &quot;quote&quot; 
      refers to a set of documents with programs for presenting the link on a 
      variety of displays. Thus, a frontend could present a mathematical equation 
      as a graph, a musical score as sheet music, and digital audio as sound played 
      on a stereo.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Link Matching<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Xanadu supplies a very powerful operation for finding links. 
      The operation takes four spec-sets as arguments: one for each end-set and 
      one for the home-set. The arguments specify the contents within which the 
      appropriate end-set must attach. The operation returns all links whose from-set 
      intersects the first argument, whose to-set intersects the second argument, 
      whose three-set intersect the third argument, and whose home-set intersects 
      the fourth argument. The example shows the arguments used to find all the 
      places at which author A quotes other authors (or himself):<br>
      <br>
      <font size=2>&nbsp; </font> 
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <dir> 
            <dir> <font size=2> from-set: span of author A’s documents<br>
              <br>
              to-set the docuverse<br>
              <br>
              three-set: the ID that specifies the ‘quote’ type.<br>
              <br>
              home-set: span of author A’s documents</font> </dir>
          </dir>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      This returns all links of type ‘quote’ that author A made from his documents 
      to anywhere within the docuverse. In the example, links were matched based 
      on their owner using the tumbler addressing architecture. The docuverse 
      (i.e., no restriction) can also be expressed with an empty spec-set. By 
      restricting the to-set to author B’s documents rather than the entire docuverse, 
      the operation would return all the places at which author A quoted author 
      B.<br>
      <br>
      Note that the link matching is an operation on the Xanadu proprietary data 
      structures and does NOT search through all the links in the docuverse!<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Link Interaction with Edits and Versions<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Links interact with edit operations and versions by staying attached 
      to the same contents, independent of their location. The chapter &quot;Addressing&quot; 
      described the derivation of a unique identity for each byte and link in 
      Xanadu. Links connect to these objects rather than to the positions of the 
      objects within documents. A consequence of this is that inserted bytes remain 
      unconnected to links, even when inserted amidst a connected group of bytes. 
      The end-set of the link effectively splits to only include the original 
      characters. In the examples below, the italicized characters are in the 
      end-set of a link.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=2>&nbsp; </font> 
      <dir> 
        <dir> <font size=2> initial text <i>This text was already here...<br>
          <br>
          </i> insert text <i>This text was al</i>inserted text <i>ready here...<br>
          <br>
          </i> rearrange text <i>This text al</i>inserted <i>was </i>text <i>ready 
          here...</i></font> </dir>
      </dir>
      Consistent interaction between links and editing operations requires that 
      the backend perform the editing operations. Frontends might be unaware of 
      all links attached to a particular span of bytes. <font face="Courier, Courier" size=1>
