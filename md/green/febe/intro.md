This overview brings you up to date on Udanax's business situation
as of
1988, plans for the software, release dates, and how frontend
developers
fit into the picture.

Since 1979 (till 1995) Udanax.com has been developing the software
to implement
a full-featured hypertext system as originally envisioned by Ted
Nelson
in 1960 and since expanded by the Udanax team. This software will
provide
a powerful, unified system for storing, relating and managing any
type of
information: text, graphics, multimedia, CAD/CAM drawings, music,
numbers.
Today, the code already embodies all the basic capabilities
necessary for
a full-featured hypertext system: links, versions, and support for
cooperating
users.

In April 1988, Autodesk, Inc. of Sausalito, California, best known
for their
AutoCAD family of software, acquired a majority interest in
Udanax.com and
is providing the funding and support needed to complete the first
Udanax
hypertext product and bring it to market. We have announced late
1989 as
our goal for our first product release.

**Product Development Plans

** The capabilities that we plan to add continue the same
themes.
A partial list of extensions includes:

* more platforms on which Udanax Green runs

* communicating backends sharing documents

* addition of timestamps to better keep track of different
versions

* implementation of access control and permissions

* addition of a historical trace which contains the edit
history
and version history of documents.

**Developers and Frontends

**In the context of the Udanax Green system, the backend
handles
storage, retrieval, versioning, linking and editing of data with
no knowledge
about the nature of the data being handled. The backend never
interacts
directly with the user; there is always a frontend handling the
FeBe Protocol.

In contrast to the backend, frontends are advanced application
packages
that:

* interact with users

* interface to input and output devices

* interpret the stored data as text, pictures or music

* format the data for display

* incorporate numeric manipulations or other operations to
be worked
on data

* are specialized to serve particular market needs

* create, implement and manage the metaphors for working
in hypertext
and hypermedia environments.

Frontends will be primarily produced by third party developers.
Udanax.com
does plan to produce at least one general purpose frontend
exemplar that
demonstrates wide usage of hypertext features, and explores some
of the
new capabilities now possible. This frontend will serve as a guide
for software
developers, and ensure that a piece of generalized hypertext
software is
available for the first product release date. Udanax.com does
*not*
intend to compete with third party developers. Udanax.com will
cooperate
with and assist its third party frontend developers.

With the backend's universal ability to handle any type of input
and any
size document network, Udanax Green can be fitted to a wide range
of applications
in all market segments. In thinking about hypertext issues, we
have identified
six areas which, because of their inherent information complexity
and the
established presence of computer technology, are strong candidates
for early
frontend applications:

1. CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) Software
development
and maintenance

A software development and maintenance product could use the
Udanax
backend to handle documentation, and manage both source and
object code,
while the frontend would offer local capabilities for
compiling, executing
and debugging programs.

2. CAD/CAM/CAE and Engineering Project Documentation
Management

The Udanax backend allows precise control over the growth of
versions
and variations in documents and diagrams. Customized and
up-to-the-minute
system descriptions can be developed more reliably, more
quickly, and
less expensively.

3. Document Library Storage and Retrieval (research groups,
legal, etc.)

Procedure manuals, policy manuals and catalogs can be
annotated for
both public and private use. The rich interconnection of
different sections
of documents allows the occasional user to swiftly find
relevant items;
the annotations allow the refinement of understanding achieved
with
experience to propagate throughout the organization at great
speed.
The result is a swifter evolution of the organization's
policies and
procedures, and swifter adaptation to changing tools,
capabilities,
and situations.

4. Office Automation and Intra-Organizational Communications
Systems

Most people work in groups, and the projects they work on are
increasingly
complex. Udanax hypertext makes possible group thinking,
planning and
writing. In one example, multiple people commonly work on
single documents
and wonder who made what change to the current draft. A single
project
produces multiple documents, all of which must be kept
consistent: specifications,
documentation, product announcement. The complexity cascades
as the
change of a single number or word must be traced out into
every other
document and corrected. Hypertext embodies the operations
necessary
to trace sources, track versions, attribute revisions, and
ensure consistency
during the process.

5. Management of Data in Complex Formats (e.g., cartographic
or geographic
data)

Research institutes often have a variety of complex data, all
in non-standard
formats. For a cartographic group this might include soil
sample lab
tests, seismic charts, LANDSAT and SPOT photos, artists'
sketches, field
reports, historical records. Only hypertext can create a
database for
the management of complex format data of this sort.

6. Computer Aided Instruction

The blending of multiple media - text, graphics, animation and
video
- allows the construction of educational material that holds
the reader's
interest. The rich linking of training modules gives the
reader the
ability to browse the material, focusing on those sections
relevant
to his curiosity at any moment, giving him a level of control
over the
order of presentation previously impossible.

This may only scratch the surface of current market opportunities.
We are
looking forward to being surprised and impressed by the variety,
inventiveness
and elegance of applications created by frontend developers.

We are interested in encouraging qualified software developers,
and in exploring
a variety of possible relationships regarding both software
development
and marketing.
