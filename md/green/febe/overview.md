**Technical
Overview**

\*\* Introduction

\**Though applications built using Udanax Green appear to be one
program, they have two communicating parts: a frontend and a backend. The
user interacts with the *frontend*. The data generated by the frontend
are stored, edited, and interconnected in the *backend\*.

\*\*Frontend

\*\*The Udanax Green hypertext system supports multiple media. Thus,
the user interaction in the frontend might consist of recording movies or
voice messages rather than simply editing text. The frontend also imposes
semantics on the data stored in the backend. For example, it translates
picture data to pictures, sound data to sounds, and text data to text. Different
frontends which manipulate different kinds of data can all communicate with
the same backend using the FeBe Protocol.

\*\*Backend

\*\*The backend does:

- data storage

- interconnection (link) storage

- editing operations

- version management

- finding information

- access control

- multi-user access

\*\*Udanax Green Objects

\*\*The Udanax Green objects in the backend visible to the frontend
are:

node - each running backend

account - one for each user

document - the unit of storage

version - a document in a version history

link - the interconnection

bytes - a data element in a document

contents - data-bytes and links together

\*\*Documents

\*\*Documents are the units of storage in Udanax Green. They store
both data-bytes and their interconnections. The data-bytes can represent
any medium, from text to digital video. Each document has separate address
spaces for the data-bytes and links (interconnections) within it. The first
space contains the data; the second the links. The two spaces together make
up the entire contents of a document.

\*\*.i.Links

\*\*Udanax Green links explicitly represent the interconnections
between pieces of data. A link connects any set of Udanax Green objects
(data-bytes, links, ranges of documents, etc.) to any other set of such
objects. They can connect data within a single document, or across document
boundaries. Each link has a completely general type field. Frontends can
use type information when displaying, matching, or following links. This
generality makes links ideal to represent the complex, irregular relations
between data in unrelated formats.

Each link is installed in a document when created. This document is the
home document for the link. The link can be copied to other documents, but
its home remains the original birth place. The location of a link is independent
of the things it connects, however. A link in one document can easily point
from another document to yet a third document.

\*\*Link Matching

\*\*To support the general link facility, Udanax Green provides a
very powerful operation for finding links that satisfy a set of constraints.
Possible constraints include tests on each link's type, author, start location,
end location, and home. (See the chapter "Links and Link Types".)

\*\*Editing and Links

\*\*Links that attach to the contents of a document must interact
in a sensible way with editing operations on that document. The basic metaphor
for that interaction is that links attach to the bytes themselves, rather
than simply the location within the document. Thus, when the bytes in question
get moved, copied, etc., the link stays attached to them. (See the chapter
"Links and Link Types".) Maintaining link connections despite
editing operations requires that the backend do the editing operations on
the stored data.

\*\*Parallel and Sequential Versions

\*\*

Two versions of a document are distinct documents related by edit operations.
Udanax Green creates a new version of a document by making an exact virtual
copy. Sequential versions appear if only one of the two versions are edited.
Multiple releases of documentation demonstrates sequential versions. Parallel
versions arise when the two documents are edited independently, such as
when two authors customize a single software manual for different applications
of the software.

\*\*Comparing Versions and Documents

\*\*To round out the version mechanism, the backend provides an operation
for comparing two documents. The comparison operation determines the contents
shared with another version of the same document or contents copied to or
from another document. In both cases, the backend records the intentional
sharing of contents. The comparison operation returns this information.

\*\*Links and Versions

\*\*The version creation operation creates a virtual copy of all
the objects in a document. Links that attach to these content objects remain
attached even when the objects exist in more than one document. Thus, links
to the shared contents of two versions are visible from within both versions.
This only happens to shared content objects, not to bytes and links inserted
later.

\*\*Finding Udanax Green Objects

\*\*Link matching is the primary operation for finding objects stored
in the Udanax Green backend. (See the chapter "Links and Link Types".)
The system can also show implicit connections from data and links to all
the documents containing them. Editing and version creation operations both
establish these connections.

The backend operations for finding Udanax Green objects depend on the special
Udanax Green data-structures -- the Enfilades. String searching operations,
for example, gain nothing from the backend architecture, and so properly
belong as part of the frontends which require such operations. (See "[Fe
vs. Be](fe-vs-be.html)".)

\*\*Access Control

\*\*The backend manages contention between multiple frontends for
individual documents by requiring each to edit their own version of the
document. This automatic version creation allows frontends to transparently
operate despite other frontends. Frontends can later resolve conflicts using
the version comparison operation.

\*\*Multi-User

\*\*Multiple users can use separate frontends simultaneously, accessing
a single backend through the FeBe Protocol over the network. Each user has
a different account. The automatic version creation on contention and the
version handling facilities combine to support multiple users interacting
with the same set of documents.
