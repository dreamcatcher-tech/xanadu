      <P ALIGN="left">Udanax Gold, formerly known as Xanadu 92.1, was in active 
        development from 1988 through 1995 at Udanax.com, and briefly at Memex 
        (now known as Filoli). 
      <P ALIGN="left">At the present time, the only body of code we have prepared 
        for external contribution is the Udanax Green code base. The Udanax Gold 
        code base is much larger and more ambitious, and will take more effort 
        before it is usable by those who haven't lived through its history. Nevertheless, 
        as an irreversible act of disclosure, we are making available on our <a href="download/index.html">download 
        page</a> the bulk of the code, and the code that embodies <i>all</i> of 
        what we were holding as proprietary secrets -- including General Enfilade 
        Theory and The Ent. 
      <p>Back in our proprietary days, we never pursued patent protection on these 
        ideas -- only trade secret. Now that the trade secrecy is gone, this disclosure 
        also constitutes prior art that prevents anyone else from preventing you 
        from using the ideas embodied in this code.</p>
      <h1>Foreign Entanglements</h1>
      <p>The rest of the Udanax.com intellectual property assets have been declared, 
        by irrevocable board decision, to be open-source (see our <a href="../license.html">license 
        page</a>), including, of course, all of Udanax Gold. However, not all 
        of it is posted yet. There is much more Udanax Gold code that we will 
        post as we extract it. However, some of our code is in the form of edits 
        to classes in the ParcPlace 2.5a image, which we have no rights to. Fortunately, 
        there are few dependencies from the code that matters to the code which 
        in entangled with ParcPlace intellectual property. We will seek an adequate 
        remedy to this problem, such as fixing these remaining dependencies.</p>
      <p>Obviously, all the code we are posting is free of such entanglements, 
        and you are free to use it without worry.</p>
      <h1>Where to from here?</h1>
      <p>At the time we originally built Udanax Gold, there were no decent object 
        platforms for delivering large object-oriented servers. There was not 
        even any one workable choice of language! Smalltalk was a great development 
        language, but the only decent Smalltalk platform at the time -- the one 
        from ParcPlace -- had a fatal runtime license fee. C++ was a plausible 
        delivery platform, but had no decent programming environments. So we developed 
        in Smalltalk and automatically translated to C++.</p>
      <p>There were no available adequate persistent object systems, distributed 
        object-message systems, or incremental-generation collectors suitable 
        for running a server. All this we built ourselves.</p>
      <p>Since then, the world has changed. Several of these components are now 
        off-the-shelf, and a few may even be adequate. To carry this code forward, 
        most pressing is to choose a single implementation language. The split 
        language effort was almost too painful when it was necessary. It is now 
        no longer necessary, but the choice of language is far from obvious. Two 
        likely candidates are <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/">Java</a>, and either of these would 
        make the conversion process less painful. Our sources are already in Smalltalk 
        (although a different version), and we can already translate to X++, which 
        bears a strong semantic resemblance to Java. </p>
      <p>We look forward to your suggestions.</p>
