      Computers have primarily let us do calculations faster, or store bits more 
      cheaply. Almost nowhere have they helped us improve or even maintain information’s 
      context, or handle its complexity.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, limited by the need to keep discrete files and by hierarchical 
      databases’ demands for uniform information neatly boxed in defined fields, 
      computer technology has provided us with useful tools...but tools that break 
      and discard the context of the information. Only relatively recently has 
      windowing technology finally given us one of the simplest of paper’s attributes: 
      the ability to keep context by having two or three pieces of paper on your 
      desk at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      John Muir observed that &quot;When we try to pick out anything by itself, 
      we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.&quot; Hypertext is 
      software that helps us keep ideas hitched together in ways that better represent 
      reality.<br>
      <br>
      In paper-based reading and writing, we have evolved a valuable set of traditions 
      to provide context for information. A page of a book has quotations and 
      citations which tell about antecedents, or about the intellectual context 
      which helped shape the author’s thoughts. We see marginalia and footnotes 
      adding bits of intriguing information or exploring paths that diverge from 
      the main thrust of the argument. In library books we occasionally see a 
      scribbled note vehemently affirming or disparaging the text. Each one of 
      these connections or associations on the page is a link: linking the writing 
      to some reader’s pungent opinion, or to collateral or source material sitting 
      on some other shelf in some other library. But beyond the pages of the books 
      are other comments connected by invisible links: book reviews, catalogues 
      and guides listing our book, and new books with footnotes that list our 
      book as a source. Imagine each of these links connected by a thread to form 
      a physical trace of complex web of context. Hypertext software lets us weave 
      that web.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Xanadu &amp; Udanax<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Xanadu began in 1960 with Ted Nelson’s simple definition of hypertext 
      as &quot;non-sequential writing&quot;: text that branches and allows choices 
      to the reader. The demands on the design have expanded since then, and our 
      understanding of fundamental issues has deepened as well. These philosophies 
      and motivations drove the technical design of the Udanax. They explain: 
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <dir> 
            <dir> • some of our unusual technical choices<br>
              <br>
              • our intent in creating a particular capability<br>
              <br>
              • the sometimes surprising absence of features standard in other 
              software </dir>
          </dir>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <font size=4><b>Importance of Context and Complexity<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>The basis of Udanax hypertext’s design is that information is 
      complex, and all information is embedded in a context that gives it meaning. 
      The common misconception is that things are meaningful by themselves, i.e., 
      that a word has an atomic definition or that documents are self-contained 
      bodies of meaning. Instead, meaning requires a topology of relationships. 
      Words and documents gain their full meaning because of their relationships 
      to other words, documents, ideas, and circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      Computer science has concentrated on better representing the document content 
      rather than the context; current text systems are built around the idea 
      of documents as islands. But the meaning to be extracted from a document 
      still depends on a person’s ability to know the context of a situation. 
      If a person does not already know the document’s significance as it relates 
      to the background of controversies or evolving knowledge, he will not understand 
      its critical points.<br>
      <br>
      With current technology, pieces of information are destroyed, get lost or 
      are stored but never found by the people who most need them. Libraries burn, 
      files are misplaced in cabinets, or a piece of knowledge is simply lost 
      in the growing sea of information. Take the notion of a theory and a refutation. 
      The two ideas are separated by space, time, authorship, perhaps even disciplines. 
      The refutation may be undiscovered and undiscoverable by a researcher, who 
      then wastes years of effort pursuing an erroneous idea. If theory and refutation 
      could be permanently linked together, the web of context would be vastly 
      enriched.<br>
      <br>
      In other areas of human information finding and sharing – decisionmaking, 
      consensus-building, debate and argumentation – we handle large and complex 
      chains of arguments in an even more haphazard fashion. For these uses, too, 
      we very much need ways to preserve context, and to build webs of relationship 
      where no technology now exists to do so.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>A Medium for Multimedia<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Information exists in a variety of forms and formats: text, film, 
      music, graphics, charts and more. Varied as the formats might be, the information 
      content is intensely intertwined. Without a single medium to represent the 
      range of forms or the interconnections, you must break up the information 
      into units your technology can manage. Our inability to deal with diversity 
      plagues us. We divide knowledge into different academic disciplines. We 
      build and run on incompatible machines. We store our information in different 
      formats, and we use incompatible software tools.<br>
      <br>
      To overcome this problem, a system must contain all types of information. 
      And, to be effective, the system must have virtually no limit on the quantity 
      of interconnected information it can support. Udanax Green can support this 
      limitless interconnection.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>The Value of Diversity<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Another key philosophical building block for us is the value 
      of diversity, the richness that comes from pluralism and freedom of choice. 
      In new and complex situations the right answer is never known at the outset; 
      we move progressively closer to a good answer through the interaction of 
      diverse opinion. Where diversity of opinion and knowledge are supported, 
      human decisions are richest and come fastest. Knowledge is accrued slowly 
      over time; where knowledge can be preserved and kept a part of the ongoing 
      discussion, we save reliving old mistakes.<br>
      <br>
      At its simplest, hypertext capitalizes on diversity’s robustness in the 
      multiple paths leading to any piece of information; in contrast, hierarchical 
      systems are built on the assumption that all people will follow the same 
      path to find a piece of information even if they need that information for 
      different reasons. In addition, non-sequential reading empowers readers 
      to follow the path of greatest interest, rather than the single road laid 
      out by an author of a linear text.<br>
      <br>
      But hypertext also addresses the problems that arise with the fragmentation 
      of knowledge. The social interaction that hypertext supports allows maximum 
      diversity to coexist and cross-fertilize.
