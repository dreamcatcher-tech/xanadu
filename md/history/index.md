# Who?

Many people made many contributions over the years. Here we attempt to
give credit for the major conceptual or technical contributions to Udanax
Green & Gold, but the long years make memory unreliable. If you know
of a contribution you feel we should have included, please let us know.
We probably just forgot, and you have our apologies. (We also intend to
acknowledge other forms of contribution eventually.)

# Systems Inspired by Xanadu**®**

### The Web

The most important of the systems inspired (or partially
inspired) by Xanadu**®** is,
obviously, the World Wide Web -- the medium on which you are presently
reading these very pages. The 1989 document [*Information
Management: A Proposal*](http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) is one of Tim Berners Lee's earliest records
of the birth of the web.
