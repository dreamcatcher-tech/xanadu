      <font size=4><b> Introduction<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Though applications built using Udanax Green appear to be one 
      program, they have two communicating parts: a frontend and a backend. The 
      user interacts with the <i>frontend</i>. The data generated by the frontend 
      are stored, edited, and interconnected in the <i>backend</i>.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Frontend<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>The Udanax Green hypertext system supports multiple media. Thus, 
      the user interaction in the frontend might consist of recording movies or 
      voice messages rather than simply editing text. The frontend also imposes 
      semantics on the data stored in the backend. For example, it translates 
      picture data to pictures, sound data to sounds, and text data to text. Different 
      frontends which manipulate different kinds of data can all communicate with 
      the same backend using the FeBe Protocol.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Backend<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>The backend does: 
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <dir> 
            <dir> * data storage<br>
              <br>
              * interconnection (link) storage<br>
              <br>
              * editing operations<br>
              <br>
              * version management<br>
              <br>
              * finding information<br>
              <br>
              * access control<br>
              <br>
              * multi-user access </dir>
          </dir>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <font size=4><b>Udanax Green Objects<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>The Udanax Green objects in the backend visible to the frontend 
      are: 
      <dir> 
        <dir> node - each running backend<br>
          <br>
          account - one for each user<br>
          <br>
          document - the unit of storage<br>
          <br>
          version - a document in a version history<br>
          <br>
          link - the interconnection<br>
          <br>
          bytes - a data element in a document<br>
          <br>
          contents - data-bytes and links together </dir>
      </dir>
      <font size=4><b>Documents<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Documents are the units of storage in Udanax Green. They store 
      both data-bytes and their interconnections. The data-bytes can represent 
      any medium, from text to digital video. Each document has separate address 
      spaces for the data-bytes and links (interconnections) within it. The first 
      space contains the data; the second the links. The two spaces together make 
      up the entire contents of a document.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>.i.Links<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Udanax Green links explicitly represent the interconnections 
      between pieces of data. A link connects any set of Udanax Green objects 
      (data-bytes, links, ranges of documents, etc.) to any other set of such 
      objects. They can connect data within a single document, or across document 
      boundaries. Each link has a completely general type field. Frontends can 
      use type information when displaying, matching, or following links. This 
      generality makes links ideal to represent the complex, irregular relations 
      between data in unrelated formats.<br>
      <br>
      Each link is installed in a document when created. This document is the 
      home document for the link. The link can be copied to other documents, but 
      its home remains the original birth place. The location of a link is independent 
      of the things it connects, however. A link in one document can easily point 
      from another document to yet a third document.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Link Matching<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>To support the general link facility, Udanax Green provides a 
      very powerful operation for finding links that satisfy a set of constraints. 
      Possible constraints include tests on each link's type, author, start location, 
      end location, and home. (See the chapter &quot;Links and Link Types&quot;.)<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Editing and Links<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Links that attach to the contents of a document must interact 
      in a sensible way with editing operations on that document. The basic metaphor 
      for that interaction is that links attach to the bytes themselves, rather 
      than simply the location within the document. Thus, when the bytes in question 
      get moved, copied, etc., the link stays attached to them. (See the chapter 
      &quot;Links and Link Types&quot;.) Maintaining link connections despite 
      editing operations requires that the backend do the editing operations on 
      the stored data.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Parallel and Sequential Versions<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Two versions of a document are distinct documents related by edit operations. 
      Udanax Green creates a new version of a document by making an exact virtual 
      copy. Sequential versions appear if only one of the two versions are edited. 
      Multiple releases of documentation demonstrates sequential versions. Parallel 
      versions arise when the two documents are edited independently, such as 
      when two authors customize a single software manual for different applications 
      of the software.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Comparing Versions and Documents<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>To round out the version mechanism, the backend provides an operation 
      for comparing two documents. The comparison operation determines the contents 
      shared with another version of the same document or contents copied to or 
      from another document. In both cases, the backend records the intentional 
      sharing of contents. The comparison operation returns this information.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Links and Versions<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>The version creation operation creates a virtual copy of all 
      the objects in a document. Links that attach to these content objects remain 
      attached even when the objects exist in more than one document. Thus, links 
      to the shared contents of two versions are visible from within both versions. 
      This only happens to shared content objects, not to bytes and links inserted 
      later.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Finding Udanax Green Objects<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Link matching is the primary operation for finding objects stored 
      in the Udanax Green backend. (See the chapter &quot;Links and Link Types&quot;.) 
      The system can also show implicit connections from data and links to all 
      the documents containing them. Editing and version creation operations both 
      establish these connections.<br>
      <br>
      The backend operations for finding Udanax Green objects depend on the special 
      Udanax Green data-structures -- the Enfilades. String searching operations, 
      for example, gain nothing from the backend architecture, and so properly 
      belong as part of the frontends which require such operations. (See &quot;<a href="fe-vs-be.html">Fe 
      vs. Be</a>&quot;.)<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Access Control<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>The backend manages contention between multiple frontends for 
      individual documents by requiring each to edit their own version of the 
      document. This automatic version creation allows frontends to transparently 
      operate despite other frontends. Frontends can later resolve conflicts using 
      the version comparison operation.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Multi-User<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Multiple users can use separate frontends simultaneously, accessing 
      a single backend through the FeBe Protocol over the network. Each user has 
      a different account. The automatic version creation on contention and the 
      version handling facilities combine to support multiple users interacting 
      with the same set of documents.
