**SUMMARY**

The on-line copyright problem may be resolvable by a simple, sweeping
permission method.  This proposed system, which anyone may use, allows
broad re-use of materials in exchange for automatic tracking of ownership. 
Payment goes to the original publisher and credit to the original author. 
Nothing is misquoted, nothing is out of context (since the original context
is immediately available), and users are not spied upon.

A wording and an abbreviation for this permission system are proposed
here.

**INTRODUCTION**

Someone who asks, "How do we keep people from stealing food?" is asking
you to consider only his side of the issue, without addressing underlying
problems.  But it might be sensible to ask another question in reply. 
If we ask, "How can the people obtain food?", perhaps both problems can
be solved together.

That is how I see the issue of copyright in digital media.  Those
who merely ask, "How do we prevent copyright infringement?" are only asking
the first question without addressing the second.  There is a hunger
for the re-use of media.  If we can find a legitimate way to feed
this hunger, then perhaps the stealing will not be necessary.

Today's central controversy seems to be the question of how to manage
copyright and royalty on the sale of digital content.

The standard question has been, "How do we prevent infringement?" 
If we re-frame the question as "How can we allow re-use?", the solution
may be simpler and more powerful than everyone thinks, with benefits for
everyone.

This reformulates an idea which occurred to the author in the fall of
1960, and which since then has been an implicit part of the Xanadu Project
(1), an ambitious system of hypermedia publishing servers with deep version
management.  Because the project has been controversial and beset
with difficulties, our fundamental copyright proposal was not understood. 
And because this method was embedded in the software that had been

designed for the Xanadu project, it was not recognized or expounded
as a separate legal permission doctrine.

In this paper, we now separate that copyright method from its software
history, and present it as a method anyone can use.  It is a legal
permission doctrine with far-reaching consequences, whose benefits may
be considerable.

**THE OBJECTIVE**

From the beginning, the objective of Project Xanadu was to facilitate
a new kind of literature: a new populist medium, a many-to-many publishing
system, not centralized in editorial and publishing companies, but open
to anyone.  It was intended to create a new kind of freedom of the
press, and make possible a deeper understanding of published materials
(2).

But this would not mean simply electronic availability of closed documents;
we would also need to re-use existing materials, and the computer could
help keep this re-use orderly (and do so without spying on users).

The idea was to preserve integrity, copyright and royalty for digital
materials, yet allow everyone freely to re-use these materials, which would
retain their identity at all times.  By allowing everyone to republish
all materials, this would effectively define a new system of fluid, digital
transmedia, with universal freedom of re-use and visualization.  All
different republications could in principle be viewed side-by-side by the
user, thus leading to

greater understanding of the material and of the points of view of
the different documents, their authors and republishers.

The scheme is simple: under this arrangement, everyone is free to republish
digital materials virtually, as quotations, anthologies and collages, provided
that the republication is virtual: that is, provided that the republisher
only provides instructions for acquisiton and assembly of the parts, and
each copy of previously-published bytes is separately purchased from the
original publisher(s) at the time of delivery.  A republisher only
distributes pointers showing how to obtain the material, and in what new
context(s) to place the material; each recipient buys these materials independently.

This method provides each receiving party with a properly-owned, independent
copy of the materials, all purchased anew from the original publisher. 
What may be just as important, it provides incentives for participation
and a method for honest re-use in a system from which all benefit.

**A PERMISSION DOCTRINE**

What is proposed here turns out actually to be, at its center, a permission
doctrine.  A new permission doctrine may be easily added to our culture;
a variety of permission doctrines are already popular, such as "shareware"
and "all rights reserved, except that churches may reprint freely."

In this proposed permission doctrine, the copyright holder gives permission
for republication, PROVIDED THAT the material is sent to users only as
an address for the material being republished, indicating what material
is to be included in what new context, and inviting the recipient to purchase
the content bytes anew from their present publisher.  When a recipient
purchases material, the material is sent with identifiers as to its origin;
and the user has software enabling these identifiers to be kept. 
This has a number of benefits: (1) the user knows the origin; (2) this
identification can be part of a proof of purchase; (3) in principle, any
recipient may republish in the same fashion, ad infinitum.

LONG FORM PERMISSION

To allow this, the copyright holder must therefore make a statement
like the following.  (Note that I am still tinkering with the provisions
and wording.)

"Permission is granted to all parties in the universe to re-publish
the bytes of these materials virtually in new on-line contexts, provided
(1) that such virtual republication consists of transmitting only a purchase
address for bytes to be included in a particular new context; and provided
(2) that the present publisher is notified of any such virtual republication."

This may be adequate to achieve the desired result, as we will consider
below.  It also leaves room for a number of possible variations.

**IRONICALLY SIMPLE**

This may seem over-simple, when mighty technical and legislative solutions
are being sought by so many parties.  But it shifts the ground of
the issue.

The new ground becomes the issue of CONTEXT RELINQUISHMENT-- the publisher's
willingness to allow the material to be used in unpredictable contexts,
in return for royalty, credit, and the immediate availability of the original
contexts for further purchase, inspection and comparison.

This is a tradeoff.  We expect publishers-- especially small, non-traditional
publishers and self-publishing individuals-- to be invigorated by the notion
of their materials being available for universal sale and re-use, to their
benefit.  More traditional publishers and authors may hesitate, not
recognizing that all the traditional objectives may be satisfied by this
system.

**IMPLIED ASPECTS**

Implied in this method are certain other aspects of implementation. 
For instance, the user must be given a receipt for each portion purchased,
so that the received materials may be proved a legitimate copy.  A
survivable memorandum of origin (the address from which purchased) must
also accompany the repurchased materials, making virtual republication
possible once again (by the new recipient).  And the republisher must
notify the original publisher of the republication, so that these re-uses
may be seen.

**SUPPORTING SOFTWARE ASPECTS**

This permission doctrine has certain minimal requirements for supporting
software.  Certain unusual software features are required:

Server-side software: The server program should have the ability to
sell materials in small amounts, ideally at a fixed price per byte, delivering
the materials with a receipt and identity notification.

Client-side software:  Certain detailed features of an unusual
nature are required in the user's programs.

1.  Viewer program with purchase methods.  Any recipient must
have a viewer program ("client software") which has methods for purchasing
the required bytes, and which retains the identity of bytes purchased.

2.  Editing program which retains identities of portions. 
Any republisher must have an editing program which retains the original
identity and addresses of the edited materials, even as they become cut
down (or re-expanded by additional purchases from the original).

3.  Stripping program.  After an author has finished creating
a document which is to include republished material, a special stripping
program (or feature) must then prepare the document for skeleton transmission,
stripping out the actual bytes and substituting the original addresses
in the necessary format for their repurchase.

**OWNERSHIP OF EACH FINAL COPY**

The recipient who purchases the suggested materials owns a final copy,
like any book, each portion legally purchased.  Even if the materials
are later withdrawn from sale, each copy already acquired in this way retains
itsownership status as the possession of the recipient.

**COMPATIBILITY, INTEROPERABILITY**

Note that any party may offer transcopyright; and note that different
variations of this arrangement, with different details of availability,
may be mixed and matched in a given document (see below).  Regardless
of such variations, a legitimate mixed copy is still owned by the final
recipient.

**THE PROPOSED FORMAT AND ITS LEGAL STATUS**

I propound for this permission system an extremely simple presentational
format. A publisher signifies participation by the following notice, in
the place of the usual copyright notice:
Trans(c)(year)(name)

For example,
Trans(c)1995 Irving Snerd

This is a shorthand form of the long-form permission stated earlier,
so that the publisher is spared having to include it.

Some distribution agency or availability scheme should also be specified
by the transcopyright grantor, as, for example:
Trans(c)1995 Irving Snerd; administered Dun & Bradstreet.

or
Ziff-Davis Trans(c)1995 Irving Snerd.

Either of these notifications tells all parties, in condensed form,
(1) that copyright is claimed; (2) that transcopyright permission is granted,
and (3)

where the materials may be bought.

It will be noted that the traditional copyright notice
(c)1995 Irving Snerd

is FULLY CONTAINED within the transcopyright notice, and so is still
present.

 

However, note also that this traditional copyright notice no longer
has its former force in law, since by today's law an author now establishes
copyright automatically by creating a work; so the copyright notice is
now regarded as being a courtesy and a convenience.  Thus we are offering
the transcopyright permission as a further courtesy, so that all parties
will know how they may republish.

By what authority is this a shorthand of the longer version?  I
hereby DECLARE it to be such a shorthand form, just as the terms "shareware"
and "copyleft," declared by Bob Wallace and Richard Stallman respectively,
have come to represent their respective permission doctrines, both now
widely accepted and used.  If others use the transcopyright notification
with the intent given here, it will be recognized in law (like shareware
and copyleft) as being synonymous with the longer permission notice.

**VARIATIONS NOT COVERED;**

**DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS**

This arrangement is for on-line screen viewing and keepage of digital
data, not for paper or other solid media.

A number of issues are not handled by this arrangement.  These
include byte modification (such as morphing, bytewise graphical operations,
and merged re-use of audio samples into a fused, mixed, inseparable recording). 
It does not involve printout.  It does not cover site licensing for
multiple users.  It does not include model releases, talent releases,
or other forms of permission not strictly part of copyright.  It does
not state how long materials will be offered for sale.

Who settles these details?  This is within the scope of variation
of the idea: different forms of transcopyright may be offered by different
parties-- individuals, companies, or other administrations.  Any party
offering transcopyright may bundle different kinds of permission into their
own systems.  (For instance, the contracts of Project Xanadu will
have specific clauses with respect to length of availability, paper printout
and site licensing.)

**ENFORCEMENT AND BENEFITS**

This system is not automatically enforced, but neither is any other
feasible electronic copyright system.  It is no more or less enforceable
than any other.  The fact that it defines a convenient method for
honest behavior, satisfying principal objectives of both publisher and
republisher-- no longer "infringer," but  honest participant-- is
a strong argument in its favor.
