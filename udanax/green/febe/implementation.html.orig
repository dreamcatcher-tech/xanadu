      <!-- #BeginEditable "LongBody" --> How does our implementation fit the demands 
      of the philosophy and motivation? The major elements of the implementation

      </dir>
      <font size=4><b>Links<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Links, more than any other feature, build and maintain the web 
      of context.<br>
      <br>
      We decided that the essential features were: 
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <dir> 
            <dir> • The ability to do extremely fine-grained linking<br>
              <br>
              • The ability to do complex linking<br>
              <br>
              • Allowing the frontend to define and interpret the meaning of links<br>
              <br>
              • The ability to follow links bidirectionally. The ability to enter 
              and exit documents quickly when following links.<br>
              <br>
              • The preservation of links across edits. </dir>
          </dir>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <font size=4><b>Fine-grained Linking<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In literature, footnotes and quotes may specify a single word. Hypertext 
      should provide similar or superior fine-grain linking: linking to a particular 
      word or to a single number. &quot;Chunky&quot; hypertext only allows you 
      to link to larger collections of data (such as &quot;cards&quot; in HyperCard). 
      The reader must then try to find the one relevant piece of information within 
      the &quot;chunk&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      Clearly the writer must be able to link to individual bytes. Such linking 
      should be at the writer’s discretion. Rather than forcing linking according 
      to some predefined hierarchy the writer should decide exactly what is included 
      as the end of a link.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Complex Linking<br>
      <br>
      </b></font> Letting the writer decide exactly what is included as the end 
      of a link means providing as much flexibility as possible. The ability to 
      freely and flexibly construct links means being able to: 
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <dir> 
            <dir> • link within documents.<br>
              <br>
              • link between documents. Example: a scholar writes a new interpretation 
              of ancient Greek society, with numerous quotations from the writings 
              of those times. The scholar could draw links from those quotes to 
              the original texts, allowing the reader to follow the link and see 
              the quote in situ.<br>
              <br>
              • link to other links. Text itself or whole documents are not the 
              only things to be linked. Links themselves have information content 
              on which people might wish to comment.<br>
              <br>
              • group disjoint sets of text, i.e., select a span of text, a span 
              of links or a span of documents and define them as a single unit 
              to form one end of a link. (The set of objects that form one end 
              of a link is known as an &quot;end-set&quot;.) On a small scale, 
              this gives the same capability as when an ellipsis links disjoint 
              text: &quot;She said…that she would do it.&quot; On a larger scale, 
              there could be a link whose end-set would be the span of all the 
              documents written by Brian Kernighan. Or, you could assemble a link 
              that had a set of disjoint spans as an end-set, such as everything 
              written by Brian Kernighan and everything written by Doug Engelbart.

      <font size=4><b>Identifying the Meaning of Links<br>
      <br>
      </b></font> As the amount of connected material begins to grow, we need 
      ways to clarify and identify links to avoid being lost in the webbed information. 
      Where is a link from? Where is the link to? What type of link is it: a quotation, 
      a refutation, a footnote, a bibliographic reference, a bibliographic collection, 
      etc.? We gave the frontend the ability to choose whether to answer these 
      questions and what meaning to give the answers.<br>
      <br>
      Why didn’t we define a series of link types ourselves? It would make things 
      simpler if Udanax itself decided on a fixed set of link types. But we also 
      realize that we couldn’t possibly know or conceive of every kind of connection 
      people would want to make. We will advocate certain conventions so things 
      written by one system are readable by another, but we will not enforce any 
      policies.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b><br>
      Bidirectional Links<br>
      <br>
      </b></font> Links need to be at least bidirectional. In other words, when 
      a link is created, the reader can go in either direction. Of course you’d 
      want to be able to go from a document to a critique of that document. But 
      imagine the person stumbling by chance into an ongoing heated technical 
      debate. He’d want to follow links backward along the chain of creation to 
      read source documents or trace the line of debate.<br>
      <br>
      Bidirectional links fulfill the scholar’s greatest fantasy: if an author 
      creates references pointing backward to earlier works, the readers of those 
      earlier works can follow the reference forward and find the later writings.<br>
      <br>
      Udanax links are actually more powerful than bidirectional links. This greater 
      power is discussed later in this document.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Stability Across Changes<br>
      <br>
      </b></font> Information is dynamic. Documents have to be editable, and you 
      want the links to survive the editing process still connected to their material. 
      You do not want the user to be referred back to some previous generation 
      of document when the link was first made, or referred to whatever text happens 
      to be at the link’s original location in the document.<br>
      <br>
      Maintaining connectivity across edits is a very difficult technical problem. 
      Its difficulty has led others to resort to &quot;chunky&quot; hypertext 
      in which all you can do is link to an entire document or to a point in a 
      hierarchy. This means that links can’t represent the real semantics of desired 
      connections.<br>
      <br>
      In Udanax Green, the links survive editing, rearranging, and changing. They 
      stay connected to the material they were connected to originally. The link 
      will show where rearranged material is now appearing in the document.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Versions<br>
      <br>
      </b></font><a name="index7"></a>Besides links, there are three other key 
      features of the Udanax Green implementation: versions, unbounded information 
      pools, and support for multiple users.<br>
      <br>
      Versioning gives us context on material over time and through changes. Even 
      relatively stable forms such as books go through drafts, versions, editions, 
      modifications for publication in different formats. Versions arise and are 
      maintained when several possible plans or variants of designs are created 
      to suit different needs or eventualities.<br>
      <br>
      In its most mundane form, version control is a frustrating problem: what 
      do you name this backup copy? where do you put it? how do you know which 
      version had the information this way or that way? But often, our need for 
      versions is acute, as when we desperately wish to be able to go back in 
      time and restore a document to an earlier state.<br>
      <br>
      Our &quot;version compare&quot; differs from the heuristic-driven content 
      comparison such as the Unix command &quot;diff&quot;. Version compare traces 
      the lineage of the actual bytes and tells how two versions differ according 
      to the edits that resulted in two documents.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b>Unbounded Information Pools<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>Udanax’s motivation is to allow users to construct and use information 
      pools of unlimited size. Much software fails because it doesn’t scale. Many 
      systems that are obviously just too small are still 10 times the maximum 
      size that the system creator imagined anyone would ever possibly want. We 
      knew we weren’t creative enough to imagine the largest thing someone might 
      want to do with the Udanax software. So we did a design that would keep 
      working as things scaled beyond our imaginations.<br>
      <br>
      This decision had interesting implications for edits: what if someone wants 
      to insert an extra word at the front of a document the size of <i>War and 
      Peace</i> – how would we handle the overhead of moving everything that followed? 
      So in our system, unlike in traditional systems, when you edit by inserting, 
      deleting or rearranging, the rest of the document is left in place.<br>
      <br>
      Tumbler addressing is an example of how we have designed Udanax Green to 
      allow maximal scaling. Each document in the system has a unique address. 
      If some years from now many Udanax Green systems were to be interconnected, 
      no confusion would result.<br>
      <br>
      <font size=4><b><br>
      Cooperating Users<br>
      <br>
      </b></font><a name="index8"></a>Existing and planned features are designed 
      to make Udanax Green good at enhancing the diversity that results from &quot;social&quot; 
      computing: collaborative editing, electronic mail, and computer conferencing.<br>
      <br>
      We support collaboration by forking versions of documents. As in a traditional 
      file system, the frontend opens a document and reserves a consistent view 
      of that document. Traditional systems can’t resolve the conflict of two 
      users writing to the same document at the same time. Udanax Green simply 
      creates a version for each writer, and then provides the facilities to resolve 
      any conflicts. <font face="Courier, Courier" size=1> </font>
