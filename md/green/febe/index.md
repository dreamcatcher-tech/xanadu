**Udanax
Green

Febe Protocol**

---

Originally written in 1988 by Dean Tribble, Mark
Miller, Gayle
Pergamit, Marc Stiegler, Roland King, Eric Hill, Johan
Strandberg, and
Roger Gregory while at or associated with Udanax.com (then known
as Xanadu
Operating Company). Many thanks to John Walker, Duff Kurland,
and others
for their help.

Adapted for the web by Udanax.com in 1999. Due to time
constraints,
there remains much text appropriate to the context of 1988 but
not to
the current situation. In particular, given the current
trademark situation,
many historical uses of "Xanadu" should properly now
read
"Udanax". When this situation is remedied, this
disclaimer
will be removed.
