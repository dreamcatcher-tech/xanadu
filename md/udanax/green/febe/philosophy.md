**Philosophy

and Motivation**

---

Computers have primarily let us do calculations faster, or store
bits more
cheaply. Almost nowhere have they helped us improve or even
maintain information's
context, or handle its complexity.

Instead, limited by the need to keep discrete files and by
hierarchical
databases' demands for uniform information neatly boxed in defined
fields,
computer technology has provided us with useful tools...but tools
that break
and discard the context of the information. Only relatively
recently has
windowing technology finally given us one of the simplest of
paper's attributes:
the ability to keep context by having two or three pieces of paper
on your
desk at the same time.

John Muir observed that "When we try to pick out anything by
itself,
we find it hitched to everything else in the universe."
Hypertext is
software that helps us keep ideas hitched together in ways that
better represent
reality.

In paper-based reading and writing, we have evolved a valuable set
of traditions
to provide context for information. A page of a book has
quotations and
citations which tell about antecedents, or about the intellectual
context
which helped shape the author's thoughts. We see marginalia and
footnotes
adding bits of intriguing information or exploring paths that
diverge from
the main thrust of the argument. In library books we occasionally
see a
scribbled note vehemently affirming or disparaging the text. Each
one of
these connections or associations on the page is a link: linking
the writing
to some reader's pungent opinion, or to collateral or source
material sitting
on some other shelf in some other library. But beyond the pages of
the books
are other comments connected by invisible links: book reviews,
catalogues
and guides listing our book, and new books with footnotes that
list our
book as a source. Imagine each of these links connected by a
thread to form
a physical trace of complex web of context. Hypertext software
lets us weave
that web.

**Xanadu & Udanax

**Xanadu began in 1960 with Ted Nelson's simple
definition of hypertext
as "non-sequential writing": text that branches and
allows choices
to the reader. The demands on the design have expanded since then,
and our
understanding of fundamental issues has deepened as well. These
philosophies
and motivations drove the technical design of the Udanax. They
explain:

* some of our unusual technical choices

* our intent in creating a particular capability

* the sometimes surprising absence of features standard in
other
software

**Importance of Context and Complexity

**The basis of Udanax hypertext's design is that
information is
complex, and all information is embedded in a context that gives
it meaning.
The common misconception is that things are meaningful by
themselves, i.e.,
that a word has an atomic definition or that documents are
self-contained
bodies of meaning. Instead, meaning requires a topology of
relationships.
Words and documents gain their full meaning because of their
relationships
to other words, documents, ideas, and circumstances.

Computer science has concentrated on better representing the
document content
rather than the context; current text systems are built around the
idea
of documents as islands. But the meaning to be extracted from a
document
still depends on a person's ability to know the context of a
situation.
If a person does not already know the document's significance as
it relates
to the background of controversies or evolving knowledge, he will
not understand
its critical points.

With current technology, pieces of information are destroyed, get
lost or
are stored but never found by the people who most need them.
Libraries burn,
files are misplaced in cabinets, or a piece of knowledge is simply
lost
in the growing sea of information. Take the notion of a theory and
a refutation.
The two ideas are separated by space, time, authorship, perhaps
even disciplines.
The refutation may be undiscovered and undiscoverable by a
researcher, who
then wastes years of effort pursuing an erroneous idea. If theory
and refutation
could be permanently linked together, the web of context would be
vastly
enriched.

In other areas of human information finding and sharing -
decisionmaking,
consensus-building, debate and argumentation - we handle large and
complex
chains of arguments in an even more haphazard fashion. For these
uses, too,
we very much need ways to preserve context, and to build webs of
relationship
where no technology now exists to do so.

**A Medium for Multimedia

**Information exists in a variety of forms and formats:
text, film,
music, graphics, charts and more. Varied as the formats might be,
the information
content is intensely intertwined. Without a single medium to
represent the
range of forms or the interconnections, you must break up the
information
into units your technology can manage. Our inability to deal with
diversity
plagues us. We divide knowledge into different academic
disciplines. We
build and run on incompatible machines. We store our information
in different
formats, and we use incompatible software tools.

To overcome this problem, a system must contain all types of
information.
And, to be effective, the system must have virtually no limit on
the quantity
of interconnected information it can support. Udanax Green can
support this
limitless interconnection.

**The Value of Diversity

**Another key philosophical building block for us is the
value
of diversity, the richness that comes from pluralism and freedom
of choice.
In new and complex situations the right answer is never known at
the outset;
we move progressively closer to a good answer through the
interaction of
diverse opinion. Where diversity of opinion and knowledge are
supported,
human decisions are richest and come fastest. Knowledge is accrued
slowly
over time; where knowledge can be preserved and kept a part of the
ongoing
discussion, we save reliving old mistakes.

At its simplest, hypertext capitalizes on diversity's robustness
in the
multiple paths leading to any piece of information; in contrast,
hierarchical
systems are built on the assumption that all people will follow
the same
path to find a piece of information even if they need that
information for
different reasons. In addition, non-sequential reading empowers
readers
to follow the path of greatest interest, rather than the single
road laid
out by an author of a linear text.

But hypertext also addresses the problems that arise with the
fragmentation
of knowledge. The social interaction that hypertext supports
allows maximum
diversity to coexist and cross-fertilize.
