**The Udanax Open-Source License**

---

Both Udanax Green and Udanax Gold, as well as all other
copyrights held by Udanax.com (formerly "XOC" or "Xanadu®
Operating Company") are hereby open-sourced under the MIT X-11 License.
All other Udanax.com intellectual property except trademark, as it is
identified, will be made available in a similarly unrestricted fashion
in the spirit of the X11 license. In particular, all Udanax.com trade-secrets,
with one exception noted below, are hereby declared open. In no case will
any other claims be used to restrict the use of any copyrighted material
in ways inconsistent with the intent of the X11 license. (Fortunately,
Udanax.com used trade-secrets rather than patents during it's proprietary
phase, so patent licensing is not an issue.)

The one exception? Video tapes, audio tapes, and email archives
of Udanax.com internal discussions will not be publicly released until
such release is cleared with the participants of each discussion. The
intent is not to hide any technical information, but to respect the sense
of privacy that may have been assumed when these discussions occurred.
Should we encounter a problem obtaining permission from the participants,
we hope to extract and release the _technical_ content anyway, as
time permits.
