# Xanadu Secrets Become Udanax Open-Source

The long history of the Xanadu®
vision of hypertext has inspired many individual hypertext efforts. Some,
such as Lotus Notes or the Web, were built by others based on aspects
of our vision. Others were created directly by one of the Xanadu
development groups -- groups working with Ted Nelson and building
on his work in order to realize his vision of hypertext, as well as other
goals inspired by this vision. Primary among such software are two systems
developed by Udanax.com, back when it was known as "XOC" or
"Xanadu Operating Company". These two systems are now known
as *[Udanax Green](green/index.html)* and *[Udanax
Gold](gold/index.html)*.

The intellectual property rights to these two systems are
held by Udanax.com, which brought them both to their current state. Based
on the intellectual-property climate of the world at the time the work
began -- long before the virtues of Open Source were widely appreciated
-- keeping this work under trade secret seemed both standard and prudent.
Today the world is very different. In celebration of the success and vast
human benefit of the Open Source movement, we are proud at last to be
able to present to the world the technical ideas and methods on which
we worked so hard for so long.

[Xanadu®
Technologies -- An Introduction](http://www.xanadu.net/TECH/) is the joint disclosure by Udanax.com
& Project Xanadu, on Monday August 23rd, 1999 at the O'Reilly Open
Source Convention, inaugurating our new celebration of openness.

# The License

There are a great variety of [open-source
licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/), but the X11 license is clearly the least restrictive of
these. Accordingly, for **The Udanax Open-Source License**, we have
taken the X11 license and filled in the blanks for the appropriate Udanax
software. See our [license page](license.html) for details.

# Philosophy and Motivation

The following documents all explain well why we built the
Udanax systems, and what we hoped to accomplish.

The [*Network
of Knowledge*](http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_14.html) chapter of Eric Drexler's 1986 Engines of Creation,
and Eric's 1987 paper *[Hypertext
Publishing and the Evolution of Knowledge](http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Hypertext/HPEK0.html)*.

The [*Philosophy &
Motivation*](green/febe/philosophy.html) chapter of our 1988 [Green
