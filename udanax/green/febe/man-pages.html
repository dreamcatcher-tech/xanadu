          intf <b>backend</b> fex<br>
          <br>
          DESCRIPTION<br>
          <br>
          <b> Backend</b> accepts requests from a frontend, such as <b>fex</b>(<b>L</b>), 
          through <b>stdin</b> and responds through <b>stdout</b> according to 
          the <b>FeBe Protocol</b> <b>88.1x</b> .<br>
          <br>
          Metaprotocol<br>
          <br>
          Initially <b>backend</b> conducts a dialogue with the frontend to establish 
          that both parties understand a common protocol. This &quot;metaprotocol&quot; 
          consists of one or more newline characters (i.e., byte value 0x0a) from 
          the frontend as synchronization; before the newlines, all input is ignored. 
          After the newlines <b>backend</b> expects to receive the string:<br>
          <br>
          P0~<br>
          <br>
          (i.e., byte values 0x50 0x30 0x7e). On seeing this, <b>backend </b>responds 
          with:<br>
          <br>
          \nP0~<br>
          <br>
          (0x0a 0x50 0x30 0x7e) meaning that <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol</b> 
          represented by &quot;0&quot; is understood. If <b>backend</b> sees any 
          other input after the last newline, it responds with:<br>
          <br>
          \nP?~<br>
          <br>
          (0x0a 0x50 0x3f 0x7e) meaning that it did not understand the frontend, 
          and then exits.<br>
          <br>
          Error Redirection<br>
          <br>
          After successful completion of the metaprotocol dialogue, <b>backend</b> 
          closes <b>stderr</b> and reopens it with the file <b>backenderror</b> 
          to avoid disrupting the frontend interaction.<br>
          <br>
          Data Structure File<br>
          <br>
          <b> Backend</b> then attempts to open the file <b>enf.enf</b> in the 
          current working directory. This file contains the data and links from 
          all sessions since it was created. If this file does not exist or has 
          been obviously corrupted, a new one is created.<br>
          <br>
          Interactive Session<br>
          <br>
          <b> Backend</b> is now ready to accept <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol 
          </b>requests. The session lasts until the frontend issues a quit request. 
          After <b>backend</b> responds with a quit code the frontend may exit. 
          After sending the quit code, <b>backend</b> updates <b>enf.enf</b> and 
          closes it before itself exiting.<br>
          <br>
          Accounts<br>
          <br>
          When <b>backend</b> starts accepting requests, the working user account 
          is set to the default account 1.1.0.1, under which new documents and 
          versions will be created until the working user account is changed with 
          the x-account request.<br>
          <br>
          Note that if the session is using a new enfilade file, neither 1.1.0.1 
          nor any other account will exist, and must be created before any documents 
          may be created. To create the account 1.1.0.1, first create the node 
          1.1 with:<br>
          <br>
          create-node-or-account 0.1.1<br>
          <br>
          and then create account 1.1.0.1 with:<br>
          <br>
          create-node-or-account 0.1.1.0.1<br>
          <br>
          Edit Logging<br>
          <br>
          <b> Backend</b> records all edit requests in a file called:<br>
          <br>
          ln<b>m</b>.<b>d</b>.<b>h</b>:<b>m<br>
          <br>
          </b> where <b>m</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>h</b>, and <b>m</b> are the month, 
          day, hour, and minute, respectively that the backend began execution. 
          Each line in this file is a single backend request. This format is possible 
          since the <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol</b> terminator character `~' 
          and a newline are accepted as identical by <b>backend</b>, and multiple 
          delimiters before a new request are ignored (treated as null requests). 
          The file is produced so that edit operations made during any session 
          may be reproduced later should <b>backend</b> fail, or for whatever 
          other reason may arise. If you want to redo the operations recorded 
          in an individual log file, edit that file so that it has at least one 
          blank line followed by &quot;P0~&quot; at the top, then invoke<font size=5> 
          </font><b>backend</b> as<br>
          <br>
          backend &lt;<b>logfile<br>
          <br>
          </b> where <b>logfile</b> is the name of the appropriate edit log. The 
          edit described above is necessary since the metaprotocol does not appear 
          in the log.<br>
          <br>
          For reconstructing entire enfilades from edit logs, it is useful to 
          concatenate the relevant logs into one file. To do this, first append 
          the files together with <b>cat</b>(<b>1</b>), or some other utility. 
          Then edit the resulting file to remove all quit requests (16~) except 
          at the last line of the file. This new file may then be used to execute 
          the contained requests in the manner described above.<br>

          BUGS<br>
          <br>
          Virtually no sanity checking is performed on the input.<br>
          <br>
          There are many possible requests, particularly edit operations on non-existent 
          addresses and creating documents in non-existent accounts that are likely 
          to corrupt the data structure.<br>
          <br>
          Numeric inputs to the backend (i.e., tumbler digits, sizes and counts) 
          are currently limited to values representable by 32 bit unsigned integers.<br>
          <br>
          Tumblers input to the backend are allowed a maximum depth of 11 tumbler 
          digits from the last leading zero digit.<br>
          <br>
          Text items for insert may be no more than 950 bytes long; larger insertions 
          must be broken into multiple text items.<br>
          <br>
          Longer items are likely to cause the program to fail (see previous bug).<br>
          <br>
          Node numbers are meaningless other than as a prefix for account numbers.<br>
          <br>
          The data file <b>enf.enf</b> has a size limit around 400K disk blocks 
          because of a kluged, fixed size allocation table.<br>
          <br>
          etc...<br>
          <br>
          NOTE<br>
          <br>
          Since the data structure is easy to corrupt with invalid, but unchecked, 
          requests it is a good idea to occasionally copy <b>enf.enf</b> to a 
          backup file.<br>

          <b> backenddaemon</b> - multiple user Udanax Green backend daemon<br>
          <br>
          TYPICAL USAGE<br>
          <br>
          <b> backenddaemon</b> is usually spawned when necessary by <b>ints</b>(<b>L</b>) 
          or <b>intx</b>(<b>L</b>), which will be referred to as &quot;glue&quot; 
          programs.<br>
          <br>
          DESCRIPTION<br>
          <br>
          <b> Backenddaemon</b> accepts and responds to requests from up to five 
          frontends through <b>socket</b>(<b>2</b>) connections using the <b>Udanax 
          Green FeBe</b> <b>Protocol</b>.<br>
          <br>
          Error Redirection<br>
          <br>
          The first action by the <b>backenddaemon</b> process is to close <b>stderr</b> 
          and reopen it as the file <b>backenderror</b> to avoid disrupting the 
          frontend interaction.<br>
          <br>
          Parameter and Data Structure Files<br>
          <br>
          <b> Backenddaemon</b> attempts to open .<b>backendrc</b> in the working 
          directory inherited from the process that spawned it, either a glue 
          program or a shell. This file is used by <b>backenddaemon</b>, both 
          glue programs, and <b>xlog</b>(<b>L</b>) to set various run-time values 
          to other than their defaults with lines of the form<br>
          <br>
          metaname = <b>word<br>
          <br>
          </b> where each program uses a different set of metanames, although 
          since they all use the same routine to read the file, lines not used 
          by a particular program must still be correct. Lines in .<b>backendrc</b> 
          beginning with &quot;#&quot; are ignored.<br>
          <br>
          <b> Backenddaemon</b> then tries to open <b>enf.enf</b> in the same 
          directory. <b>Enf.enf</b> contains the data and links from all sessions 
          since it was created. If this file does not exist or has been obviously 
          corrupted, a new one is created.<br>
          <br>
          Connection to Frontend<br>
          <br>
          After the data structure initialization, <b>backenddaemon</b> creates 
          a <b>socket</b>(<b>2</b>) with AF INET address format and SOCK_STREAM 
          communications semantics. This socket is then bound to either the default 
          port 55146 or the port given by<br>
          <br>
          port = <b>port-number<br>
          <br>
          </b> in .<b>backendrc</b>. The socket address is set to INADDR_ANY so 
          that connections will be accepted from any host in the domain. <b>Backenddaemon</b> 
          then waits for frontend connections with <b>select</b>(<b>2</b>). It 
          is up to a frontend or a glue program to attach to the socket with <b>connect</b>(<b>2</b>).<br>
          <br>
          After a connection is established, <b>backenddaemon</b> reads a device 
          name from the socket. This name should be &quot;SOCKET&quot; if frontend 
          interaction is to be through the socket. <b>Ints</b>(<b>L</b>) uses 
          this mechanism. Otherwise, <b>backenddaemon</b> will communicate through 
          the named device; see <b>intx</b>(<b>L</b>) for an example of this method.<br>
          <br>
          After the device name is acquired, but before it is used, <b>backenddaemon</b> 
          expects an x-account request over the socket to establish the initial 
          account to be used (see Accounts, below).<br>
          <br>
          When the account is set, <b>backenddaemon</b> switches to the nonsocket 
          device if one was specified, otherwise communication continues to the 
          original socket connection.<br>
          <br>
          Metaprotocol<br>
          <br>
          Next, <b>backenddaemon</b> conducts a dialog with the frontend to establish 
          that both parties understand a common protocol. This &quot;metaprotocol&quot; 
          consists of one or more newline characters (i.e., byte value 0x0a) from 
          the frontend as synchronization; before the newlines, all input is ignored. 
          After the newlines, <b>backenddaemon</b> expects to receive the string:<br>
          <br>
          P0~<br>
          <br>
          (i.e., byte values 0x50 0x30 0x7e). On seeing this, <b>backenddaemon</b> 
          responds with:<br>
          <br>
          \nP0~<br>
          <br>
          (0x0a 0x50 0x30 0x7e) meaning that <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol </b>represented 
          by &quot;0&quot; is understood. If <b>backenddaemon</b> sees any other 
          input after the last newline, it responds with:<br>
          <br>
          \nP?~<br>
          <br>
          (0x0a 0x50 0x3f 0x7e) meaning that it did not understand the frontend, 
          and then closes the connection.<br>
          <br>
          Interactive Session<br>
          <br>
          <b> Backenddaemon</b> is now ready to accept <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol 
          </b> requests. The session lasts until the frontend issues a quit request. 
          After <b>backenddaemon</b> responds with a quit code the frontend may 
          exit. After the quit command, <b>Backend</b> closes the connection that 
          the frontend was using.<br>

          BUGS<br>
          <br>
          In .<b>backendrc</b>, whitespace is required on both sides of the &quot;=&quot; 
          on each line.<br>
          <br>

          See <b>backend</b>(<b>L</b>) for more bugs.<br>
          <br>
          NOTES<br>
          <br>
          Since the data structure is easy to corrupt with invalid but unchecked 
          requests, it is a good idea to occasionally copy <b>enf.enf</b> to a 
          backup file.<br>
          <br>
          The limit of 5 frontend connections is an arbitrary one, and does not 
          reflect any limitations in the internal structure of the backend. The 
          <b>socket</b>(<b>2</b>) facility was chosen because it was simple enough 
          to not distract from the development of the more intricate Udanax hypertext 
          functionality (i.e., it was a quick hack).<br>

          <b> fex</b> is normally invoked by a &quot;glue&quot; program such as 
          <b>intf</b> that starts both the frontend and the backend and sets up 
          the pipes to allow them to communicate.<br>
          <br>
          DESCRIPTION<br>
          <br>
          <b> fex</b> is a screen-oriented program resembling a visual text editor 
          which provides a user interface to the Udanax Green backend <b>backend</b>(<b>L</b>). 
          There is no explicit insert mode: alphanumeric characters typed at any 
          time are inserted into the text under the cursor position. The DEL key 
          is used to delete characters before the cursor position.<br>
          <br>
          When <b>fex</b> is invoked it automatically locates and places on the 
          screen a document (1.1.0.1.0.1) that serves as an entry point to the 
          system. This document contains a summary of frontend commands and a 
          link connecting it to another document that serves as a general index. 
          Additional commands are invoked through a pop-up menu.<br>

                <dir> 
                  <dir> <b> end-set</b> A region of text (possibly discontinuous 
                    and possibly spanning more than one document) connected to 
                    another such region by a link.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b> link</b> A connection between two end-sets, modified by 
                    a third end-set. These are respectively called the <b>from-set</b>, 
                    <b>to-set</b>, and <b>three-set</b>, of the link. <b>From-sets</b> 
                    are displayed as back-lit; <b>to-sets</b> as underlined (termcap 
                    permitting) or as back-lit. <b>Three-sets</b> are used to 
                    describe the intended meaning of the link, such as if it is 
                    a jump link or a footnote link. The distinction between from-sets 
                    and to-sets reflects the link author's intentions rather than 
                    any functional difference. The from-sets and to-sets of a 
                    link are really symmetrical.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b> cut</b> A temporary mark made in the text to specify boundaries 
                    of an end-set for a link to be created, or a section to be 
                    rearranged or deleted.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b> display style</b> When a link is followed, the text at 
                    the destination is displayed in a window that can be a quarter-screen 
                    (default), a horizontal half-screen, a vertical half-screen, 
                    or an entire screen. The display style can be changed through 
                    the menu (see below). If a window was created by following 
                    a link, its display style is initially determined by the three-set 
                    of that link.<br>

          BUGS<br>
          <br>
          This is an experimental frontend. The following bugs are known to exist. 
          There are undoubtedly others. 
          <dir> 
            <dir> 1. Hitting DELETE with the cursor in the first position of a 
              window causes a fatal error.<br>
              <br>
              2. Text cannot be inserted below the last line of a document. Attempts 
              to do so cause a fatal error. To append text to a document, place 
              the cursor at the end of the last line and hit RETURN. Blank lines 
              may be appended with repeated RETURNs.<br>
              <br>
              3. Deletion of text in a newly-created document (i.e., one created 
              in the current invocation of <b>fex</b>) may result in a mispositioning 
              of the cursor. The actual document <b>should</b> be edited correctly. 
              However, it is recommended that editing of newly-created documents 
              be kept to a minimum. </dir>

          <br>
          intf <b>backend frontend<br>
          <br>
          </b> DESCRIPTION<br>
          <br>
          <b> Intf</b> uses the <b>pipe</b>(<b>2</b>) facility to connect a frontend 
          program to the standard I/O of a program such as <b>backend</b>(<b>L</b>).<br>
          <br>
          Two pipes are created by <b>intf</b>, one from the frontend to the backend, 
          the other in the opposite direction. One end of each pipe is attached 
          to <b>stdin</b> and <b>stdout</b>. <b>Intf</b> then forks and executes 
          the backend program with these pipes as its standard I/O. The original 
          branch of the fork then executes the frontend program with the file 
          descriptor numbers for the other ends of the pipes passed as command 
          line arguments in the form<br>
          <br>
          frontend <b>pipe-from-backend pipe-to-backend<br>
          <br>
          </b> so that the frontend can communicate with the backend through them. 
          <b>Intf</b> does not exit if successful, turning into the frontend instead.<br>

          <b> ints</b> - connect a frontend to a Udanax Green backend daemon<br>
          <br>
          SYNOPSIS<br>
          <br>
          ints <b>frontend account<br>
          <br>
          </b> DESCRIPTION<br>
          <br>
          <b> Ints</b> uses the <b>socket</b>(<b>2</b>) facility to connect a 
          frontend program to <b>daemon</b>(<b>L</b>).<br>
          <br>
          <b> Ints</b> first reads the file .<b>backendrc</b> in the current directory. 
          If the line<br>
          <br>
          backenddir = <b>path<br>
          <br>
          </b> is present, <b>ints</b> sets <b>path</b> as its working directory, 
          otherwise the directory is unchanged.<br>
          <br>
          Next, <b>ints</b> acquires a socket with AF_INET address format and 
          SOCK_STREAM semantics-the same form as <b>daemon</b>(<b>L</b>). <b>Ints</b> 
          then binds the socket to a specific port and host. The default port 
          is 55146 and the default host is localhost, although these can be changed 
          in .<b>backendrc</b> with<br>
          <br>
          port = <b>port-number<br>
          <br>
          </b> and<br>
          <br>
          host = <b>host-name<br>
          <br>
          Connect</b>(<b>2</b>) is then called with this binding. If the connection 
          is not made, <b>ints</b> spawns a daemon on the local host machine with 
          <b>fork</b>(<b>2</b>) and <b>execl</b>(<b>2</b>). The default daemon 
          is <b>backenddaemon</b> in the directory set above, but this may be 
          changed with<br>
          <br>
          backend = <b>daemon-name<br>
          <br>
          </b> in .<b>backendrc</b>. <b>Ints</b> then makes a second attempt to 
          connect after a 15 second wait. A second failure results in termination.<br>
          <br>
          Once the connection is acquired, <b>ints</b> sends the string &quot;SOCKET&quot; 
          to <b>daemon</b> to indicate that the socket connection will be used 
          by the frontend. <b>Ints</b> then sends an x-account request to <b>daemon</b> 
          with the account number from the command line.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, <b>ints</b> executes the frontend program. The default frontend 
          is <b>fex</b> in the directory set above, but may be changed with<br>
          <br>
          frontend = <b>frontend-name<br>
          <br>

          frontend <b>from-backend to-backend<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          <b> Intx</b> is almost identical to <b>ints</b>(<b>L</b>). Instead of 
          connecting to a frontend via a socket, however, <b>intx</b> connects 
          the backend to the terminal that is attached to <b>stdin</b>. The purpose 
          of this is to allow a frontend program running on a different machine 
          connected to a network host via a serial line to connect to a Udanax 
          Green backend.<br>

          <br>
          DESCRIPTION<br>
          <br>
          <b> Xlog</b> attempts to find an Udanax Green account number based on 
          a user name, if any, and then invokes either <b>ints</b>(<b>L</b>) or 
          <b>intx</b>(<b>L</b>) with that account number. If no user name is given, 
          account 1.1.0.1 is used.<br>
          <br>
          <b> Xlog</b> first reads .<b>backendrc</b> in the current directory. 
          If the line<br>
          <br>
          backenddir = <b>path<br>

          </b> is present, <b>xlog</b> sets <b>path</b> as its working directory, 
          otherwise the directory is unchanged. <b>Xlog</b> then prompts for a 
          password (which is not checked), and looks for the account number for 
          <b>user-name</b> in either <b>accountfile</b> in the directory set above, 
          or in the file named by<br>
          <br>
          accountfile = <b>file-name<br>

          <br>
          <b> Xlog</b> then asks if you want to run the standard frontend (through 
          <b>ints</b>(<b>L</b>)) or one running on a different machine (connected 
          via <b>intx</b>(<b>L</b>)). The appropriate program is then executed,

          <b> xumain</b> - interactive stand alone Udanax Green backend with awful

          <br>
          SYNOPSIS<br>
          <br>
          xumain [ &lt; <b>setup-script</b> ]<br>
          <br>
          DESCRIPTION<br>
          <br>
          <b> Xumain</b> is a quasi-interactive stand alone version of <b>backend</b>(<b>L</b>), 
          which does not use the <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol </b> syntax, instead 
          prompting for input to most requests. <b>Xumain</b> does, however, have 
          enough similarities to <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol </b> for the protocol 
          document to be a useful reference.<br>
          <br>
          <b> Xumain</b> is the original Udanax Green backend, written before 
          any frontend, and was intentionally left as a user-hostile program to 
          encourage us to really write a frontend. The program continues to exist 
          principally as a tool to create Udanax Green documents from text files 
          using the source-unix-command command, which should really be a function 
          of some<br>
          <br>
          frontend.<br>
          <br>
          Spec-sets<br>
          <br>
          Spec-sets, spans, and v-spans are handled differently by <b>xumain</b>, 
          with prompts for yes/no responses to determine which type to use; some 
          of the prompts are context dependent. Tumblers are also different: <b>xumain</b> 
          requires that the leading zeros of a tumbler are explicitly given, rather 
          than with an exponent. All the prompts below that end with &quot;=&gt;&quot; 
          require a tumbler according to the <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol</b>. 
          When a spec set is expected the user is prompted with<br>
          <br>
          any spans or vspecs? (y/n)<br>
          <br>
          where span has its usual meaning and vspec is a document number with 
          a set of v-spans. The spec set is terminated with a negative response 
          to this prompt. A positive response is followed by the prompt<br>
          <br>
          a span? (y/n)<br>
          <br>
          This is asking whether you want a span or a collection of v-spans within 
          a document. A `yes' answer elicits a prompt for a span:<br>
          <br>
          enter span<br>
          <br>
          start=&gt;<br>
          <br>
          width=&gt;<br>
          <br>
          If you respond with `no', then you will be prompted for a document number 
          with<br>
          <br>
          document=&gt;<br>
          <br>
          and then for a v-span set with<br>
          <br>
          any spans? (y/n)<br>
          <br>
          except that this time, the span in question is a v-span. V-spans are 
          requested until a `no' answer, after which you will be prompted for 
          the next spec.<br>
          <br>
          As an example consider this request to retrieve the first 10 characters 
          from the document 1.1.0.1. (The emphasized text is the user's response.): 
          <dir> 
            <dir> request? <b>5<br>
              <br>
              </b> any spans or vspecs? (y/n) <b>y<br>
              <br>
              </b> a span? (y/n) <b>n<br>
              <br>
              </b> document=&gt; <b>1.1.0.1<br>
              <br>
              </b> any spans? (y/n) <b>y<br>
              <br>
              </b> enter span<br>
              <br>
              start=&gt; <b>1.1<br>
              <br>
              </b> width=&gt; <b>0.10<br>
              <br>
              </b> any spans? (y/n) <b>n<br>
              <br>
              </b> any spans of vspecs? (y/n) <b>n<br>
              <br>
              </b> </dir>
          </dir>
          Assuming they are present, <b>xumain</b> will then respond with those 
          10 characters.<br>
          <br>
          Commands<br>
          <br>
          There are four commands, x-account, create-node-or-account, open, and 
          close which do not prompt for their arguments. All these, however, accept 
          the same arguments as <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol</b>, but separated 
          by newlines rather than the <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol </b> word 
          delimiter character.<br>
          <br>
          The insert request in <b>xumain</b> has an important difference from 
          <b>Udanax Green FeBe Protocol.</b> Rather than giving a count of the 
          number of characters in the text item, the input text is terminated 
          with a blank line.<br>
          <br>
          There is a request unique to <b>xumain</b> called source-unix-command, 
          which is request number 21. This asks for a command for execution by 
          <b>sh</b>(<b>1</b>) with the standard output directed to a file with 
          the name &quot;xum&quot; followed by <b>xumain's</b> process number. 
          A new document is created and the command output is placed there. The 
          new document number is printed for future use. Finally, the output file 
          is deleted.<br>
